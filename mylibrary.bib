The current paper dissects Tendermint under various system communication models and Byzantine adversaries. Our methodology consists in identifying the algorithmic principles of Tendermint necessary for a specific combination of communication model-adversary. This methodology allowed to identify bugs [3] in preliminary versions of the protocol ([19], [7]) and to prove its correctness under the most adversarial conditions: an eventually synchronous communication model and asymmetric Byzantine faults.},

We call the framework of computation through a scriptable cryptocurrency a consensus computer and de-velop a model that captures incentives for verifying com-putation in it. We propose a resolution to the verifier's dilemma which incentivizes correct execution of certain ap-plications, including outsourced computation, where scripts require minimal time to verify.

Distributed transactions are often rejected as an undesirable tradeoff today, but in the absence of transactions there are few concrete principles or tools to help programmers design and verify the correctness of their applications. We address this situation with the CALM principle, which con- nects the idea of distributed consistency to program tests for logical monotonicity. We then introduce Bloom, a distributed programming language that is amenable to high-level consistency analysis and encourages order-insensitive programming. We present a prototype implementation of Bloom as a domain-specific language in Ruby. We also propose a program analysis technique that identifies points of order in Bloom programs: code locations where programmers may need to inject coordination logic to ensure consistency. We illustrate these ideas with two case studies: a simple key-value store and a distributed shopping cart service.},

All past approaches towards constructing SMR fail to achieve either small confirmation time or small bandwidth under adaptive corruptions (without resorting to strong assumptions such as the erasure model or proof-of-work).



We show that amazingly, not only can this new paradigm achieve consensus (e.g., on a batch of unconfirmed transactions in a cryptocurrency system), but it also allows us to derive the first SMR protocol which, even under adaptive corruptions, requires only polylogarithmically many rounds and polylogarithmically many honest messages to be multicast to confirm each batch of transactions; and importantly, we attain these guarantees under standard cryptographic assumptions.},

	abstract = {The concept of partial synchrony in a distributed system is introduced. Partial synchrony lies between the cases of a synchronous system and an asynchronous system. In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound A on the time required for a message to be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound \% on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds A and @ exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds A and Cp exist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardless of the actual values of the bounds A and Cp. In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardless of when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensus protocols are given for various cases of partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most cases that our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensus protocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant {\textquotedblleft}distributed clocks{\textquotedblright} that allow partially synchronous processors to reach some approximately common notion of time.

	abstract = {The blockchain initially gained traction in 2008 as the technology underlying bitcoin, but now has been employed in a diverse range of applications and created a global market worth over \$150B as of 2017. What distinguishes blockchains from traditional distributed databases is the ability to operate in a decentralized setting without relying on a trusted third party. As such their core technical component is consensus: how to reach agreement among a group of nodes. This has been extensively studied already in the distributed systems community for closed systems, but its application to open blockchains has revitalized the field and led to a plethora of new designs. The inherent complexity of consensus protocols and their rapid and dramatic evolution makes it hard to contextualize the design landscape. We address this challenge by conducting a systematic and comprehensive study of blockchain consensus protocols. After first discussing key themes in classical consensus protocols, we describe: first protocols based on proof-of-work (PoW), second proof-of-X (PoX) protocols that replace PoW with more energy-efficient alternatives, and third hybrid protocols that are compositions or variations of classical consensus protocols. We develop a framework to evaluate their performance, security and design properties, and use it to systematize key themes in the protocol categories described above. This evaluation leads us to identify research gaps and challenges for the community to consider in future research endeavours.},

Inspired by the guifi.net case and its commons governance model, we claim that a computing cloud, another digital infrastructure, can also be managed as an open commons if the appropriate tools are put in place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and sustainability of community clouds as open commons: open user-driven clouds formed by community-managed computing resources. We propose organising the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) cloud service layers as common-pool resources (CPR) for enabling a sustainable cloud service provision. On this basis, we have outlined a governance framework for community clouds, and we have developed Cloudy, a cloud software stack that comprises a set of tools and components to build and operate community cloud services. Cloudy is tailored to the needs of the guifi.net community network, but it can be adopted by other communities. We have validated the feasibility of community clouds in a deployment in guifi.net of some 60 devices running Cloudy for over two years. To gain insight into the capacity of end-user services to generate enough value and utility to sustain the whole cloud ecosystem, we have developed a file storage application and tested it with a group of 10 guifi.net users. The experimental results and the experience from the action research confirm the feasibility and potential sustainability of the community cloud as an open commons.},

	abstract = {One of the main reasons why Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) systems are not widely used lies in their high resource consumption: 3f+1 replicas are necessary to tolerate only f faults. Recent works have been able to reduce the minimum number of replicas to 2f+1 by relying on a trusted subsystem that prevents a replica from making conflicting statements to other replicas without being detected. Nevertheless, having been designed with the focus on fault handling, these systems still employ a majority of replicas during normal-case operation for seemingly redundant work. Furthermore, the trusted subsystems available trade off performance for security; that is, they either achieve high throughput or they come with a small trusted computing base. This paper presents CheapBFT, a BFT system that, for the first time, tolerates that all but one of the replicas active in normal-case operation become faulty. CheapBFT runs a composite agreement protocol and exploits passive replication to save resources; in the absence of faults, it requires that only f+1 replicas actively agree on client requests and execute them. In case of suspected faulty behavior, CheapBFT triggers a transition protocol that activates f extra passive replicas and brings all non-faulty replicas into a consistent state again. This approach, for example, allows the system to safely switch to another, more resilient agreement protocol. CheapBFT relies on an FPGA-based trusted subsystem for the authentication of protocol messages that provides high performance and comprises a small trusted computing base.},

To reduce cost, we incorporate on-demand instantiation, which activates a subset of replicas first and activates backup ones when active ones fail. To solve its key limitation{\textemdash}the system can be halted for long when activating a backup replica, we apply lazy recovery, al- lowing the system to proceed while recovering backup nodes in the background. The key contribution of this paper is to identify that, when agreement nodes and exe- cution nodes are logically separated, they each presents a unique property that enables lazy recovery. We have ap- plied this idea to Paxos and built ThriftyPaxos, which, as shown in the evaluation, can achieve higher throughput and similar availability comparing to standard Paxos, de- spite the fact that ThriftyPaxos activates fewer replicas.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00037},
	abstract = {Off-chain scaling techniques allow mutually distrustful parties to execute a contract locally among themselves instead of on the global blockchain. Parties involved in the transaction maintain a multi-signature fraud-proof off-chain replicated state machine, and only resort to on-chain consensus when absolutely necessary (e.g., when two parties disagree on a state). Off-chain scaling is the only way to support fully scale-out decentralized applications ("dApps") with better privacy and no compromise on the trust and decentralization guarantees. It is the inflection point for blockchain mass adoption, and will be the engine behind all scalable dApps. Celer Network is an Internet-scale, trust-free, and privacy-preserving platform where everyone can quickly build, operate, and use highly scalable dApps. It is not a standalone blockchain but a networked system running on top of existing and future blockchains. It provides unprecedented performance and flexibility through innovation in off-chain scaling techniques and incentive-aligned cryptoeconomics. Celer Network embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component, including a generalized state channel and sidechain suite that supports fast and generic off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal value transfer routing mechanism that achieves an order of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development framework and runtime for off-chain applications; and a new cryptoeconomic model that provides network effect, stable liquidity, and high availability for the off-chain ecosystem.},

Implementations proposed in the literature so far have relied on state machine replication and reach agreement on each individual set element in sequence. We introduce set-union consensus, a specialization of Byzantine consensus that reaches agreement over whole sets. This primitive admits an efficient and simple implementation by the composition of Eppstein's set reconciliation protocol with Ben-Or's ByzConsensus protocol. A free software implementation of this construction is available in GNUnet. Experimental results indicate that our approach results in an efficient protocol for very large sets, especially in the absence of Byzantine faults. We show the versatility of set-union consensus by using it to implement distributed key generation, ballot collection, and cooperative decryption for an electronic voting protocol implemented in GNUnet.

Consequently, faulttolerance in CPS becomes a challenging task, especially when accounting for failures (potentially malicious) that incapacitate the gateway or disrupt the nodes-gateway communication, not to mention the energy, timeliness, and security constraints demanded by CPS domains. This paper aims at ameliorating the fault-tolerance of WSN based CPS to increase system and data availability. To this end, we propose a replicated gateway architecture augmented with energy-efficient real-time Byzantineresilient data communication protocols. At the sensors level, we introduce FT-TSTP, a geographic routing protocol capable of delivering messages in an energy-efficient and timely manner to multiple gateways, even in the presence of voids caused by faulty and malicious sensor nodes. At the gateway level, we propose a multi-gateway synchronization protocol, which we call ByzCast, that delivers timely correct data to CPS applications, despite the failure or maliciousness of a number of gateways. We show, through extensive simulations, that our protocols provide better system robustness yielding an increased system and data availability while meeting CPS energy, timeliness, and security demands.},

Bulletproofs are especially well suited for efficient range proofs on committed values: they enable proving that a committed value is in a range using only 2 log 2 pn 9 group and field elements, where n is the bit length of the range. Proof generation and verification times are linear in n. Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs currently used to implement Confidential Transactions (CT) in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Bulletproofs supports aggregation of range proofs, so that a party can prove that m commitments lie within a given range by providing only an additive Oplogpmqq group elements over the length of a single proof. To aggregate proofs from multiple parties, we enable the parties to generate a single proof without revealing their inputs to each other via a simple multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for constructing Bulletproofs. This MPC protocol uses either a constant number of rounds and linear communication, or a logarithmic number of rounds and logarithmic communication. Bulletproofs build on the techniques of Bootle et al. (EUROCRYPT 2016). Beyond range proofs, Bulletproofs provide short zero-knowledge proofs for general arithmetic circuits while only relying on the discrete logarithm assumption and without requiring a trusted setup.

	url = {https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08541},
	abstract = {A smart contract on a blockchain cannot keep a secret because its data is replicated on all nodes in a network. To remedy this problem, it has been suggested to combine blockchains with trusted execution environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX, for executing applications that demand privacy. As a consequence untrusted blockchain nodes cannot get access to the data and computations inside the TEE. This paper first explores some pitfalls that arise from the combination of TEEs with blockchains. Since smart contracts executed inside TEEs are, in principle, stateless they are susceptible to roll-back attacks, which should be prevented to maintain privacy for the application. However, in blockchains with non-final consensus protocols, such as the proof-of-work in Ethereum and others, the contract execution must handle rollbacks by design. This implies that TEEs for securing blockchain execution cannot be directly used for such blockchains; this approach works only when the consensus decisions are final. Second, this work introduces an architecture and a prototype for smart-contract execution within Intel SGX technology for Hy-perledger Fabric, a prominent enterprise blockchain platform. Our system resolves difficulties posed by the execute-order-validate architecture of Fabric, prevents rollback attacks on TEE-based execution as far as possible, and minimizes the trusted computing base. For increasing security, our design encapsulates each application on the blockchain within its own enclave that shields it from the host system. An evaluation shows that the overhead moving execution into SGX is within 10\%-20\% for a sealed-bid auction application.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of smart devices to collect data and make intelligent decisions. However, a lack of intrinsic security measures makes IoT vulnerable to privacy and security threats. With its {\textquotedblleft}security by design,{\textquotedblright} Blockchain (BC) can help in addressing major security requirements in IoT. BC capabilities like immutability, transparency, auditability, data encryption and operational resilience can help solve most architectural shortcomings of IoT. This article presents a comprehensive survey on BC and IoT integration. The objective of this paper is to analyze the current research trends on the usage of BC-related approaches and technologies in an IoT context. This paper presents the following novelties, with respect to related work: (i) it covers different application domains, organizing the available literature according to this categorization, (ii) it introduces two usage patterns, i.e., device manipulation and data management (open marketplace solution), and (iii) it reports on the development level of some of the presented solutions. We also analyze the main challenges faced by the research community in the smooth integration of BC and IoT, and point out the main open issues and future research directions. Last but not least, we also present a survey about novel uses of BC in the machine economy.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms. In this paper, we first describe BlockBench, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BlockBench via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BlockBench measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BlockBench to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the software stack.},

@techreport{bissoliAuthenticationServiceShamir2018,
	title = {Authentication as a service: {Shamir} {Secret} {Sharing} with byzantine components},
	abstract = {We present a practical methodology for securing the classical password-based authentication scheme, since in many cases this type of authenti-cation is given as a requirement. We propose a solution based on the well-known (k, n) threshold scheme of Shamir for sharing a secret, where in our case the secret is the password itself and (k, n) threshold scheme means that n password-derived secrets (shares) are created and k <= n shares are necessary and sufficient for reconstructing the password, while k - 1 are not sufficient. The scheme is information-theoretic secure. Since each of the n shares is stored on a different host (shareholder), an attacker will need to compromise k different shareholders for obtaining an amount of data sufficient for reconstructing the secret. Furthermore, in order to be resistant to the compromising of the server (dealer) coordinating the shareholders we define a variant of the classic Shamir, where the Shamir's abscissae are unknown to dealer and shareholders, making the reconstruction impossible even in the case of dealer and shareholders compromised. In addition we use the Pedersen technique for allowing the verification of shares. For the described scenario we have designed two protocols allowing the communication between application, dealer and shareholders, so that the relevant players can participate to the phases of registration (user's sign-up, to be carried out once), and of authentication (user's login). We analyse several scenarios where dealer and/or shareholders are par-tially/totally compromised and confirm that none of them is enabling the attacker to break the authentication. Furthermore we focus on cases where one or more byzantine servers are presented, analysing the impact on the framework and show the adopted mechanisms to be safe against these kinds of attacks. We have developed a prototype demonstrating that our framework works correctly, effectively and efficiently. It provides a first feasibility study that will provide a base for structured and engineered cloud-based implementations aiming at providing an authentication-as-a-service.},

	abstract = {Distributed Ledgers (e.g. Bitcoin) occupy currently the first lines of the economical and political media and many speculations are done with respect to their level of coherence and their computability power. 
Interestingly, there is no consensus on the properties and abstractions that fully capture the behaviour of distributed ledgers. The interest in formalising the behaviour of distributed ledgers is twofold. Firstly, it helps to prove the correctness of the algorithms that implement existing distributed ledgers and explore their limits with respect to an unfriendly environment and target applications.
\%
Secondly, it facilitates the identification of  the minimal building blocks necessary to implement the distributed ledger  in a specific environment. 

Even though the behaviour of distributed ledgers is similar to abstractions that have been deeply  studied for decades in distributed systems  no abstraction is sufficiently powerful to capture the distributed ledger behaviour.

This paper introduces the Distributed Ledger Register, a register  that mimics the behaviour of one of the most popular distributed ledger, i.e. the Bitcoin ledger. The aim of our work is to provide formal guarantees on the coherent evolution of Bitcoin. We furthermore show that the Bitcoin blockchain maintenance algorithm verifies the distributed ledger register properties under strict conditions.  Moreover, we prove that the Distributed Ledger Register verifies the regularity register specification. It follows   that the strongest coherency implemented by Bitcoin is  regularity under strong assumptions (i.e. partial synchronous systems and  sparse reads). This study contradicts the common belief that Bitcoin implements strong coherency criteria in a totally asynchronous system. 
 To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that makes the connection between the distributed ledgers and the classical theory of distributed shared registers.},

	abstract = {Most classical consensus protocols rely on a leader to coordinate nodes{\textquoteright} voting efforts. One novel idea that stems from blockchain-style consensus is to rely, instead, on a {\textquotedblleft}longest-chain{\textquotedblright} idea for such coordination. Such a longest-chain idea was initially considered in randomized protocols, where in each round, a node has some probability of being elected a leader who can propose the next block. Recently, well-known systems have started implementing the deterministic counterpart of such longest-chain protocols {\textemdash} the deterministic counterpart is especially attractive since it is even simpler to implement than their randomized cousins. A notable instantiation is the Aura protocol which is shipped with Parity{\textquoteright}s open-source Ethereum implementation. Interestingly, mathematical analyses of deterministic, longest-chain protocols are lacking even though there exist several analyses of randomized versions. In this paper, we provide the first formal analysis of deterministic, longest-chain-style consensus. We show that a variant of the Aura protocol can defend against a Byzantine adversary that controls fewer than 1/3 fraction of the nodes, and this resilience parameter is tight by some technical interpretation. Based on insights gained through our mathematical treatment, we point out that Aura{\textquoteright}s concrete instantiation actually fails to achieve the resiliene level they claim. Finally, while our tight proof for the longest-chain protocol is rather involved and non-trivial; we show that a variant of the {\textquotedblleft}longest-chain{\textquotedblright} idea which we call {\textquotedblleft}largest-set{\textquotedblright} enables a textbook construction that admits a simple proof (albeit with slower confirmation).},

The thermal and tribological properties of silicon composites were improved by choosing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a thickener and alumina nitride (AlN) and flake graphite (FG) as thermal conductive additives, producing AlN-modified, FG-modified, and AlN/FG-modified PTFE-based thermal silicon composites (AlN{\textendash}PTSC, FG{\textendash}PTSC, and AlN/FG{\textendash}PTSC, respectively). Three-dimensional network-configuration representative volume element models were built to investigate the thermal properties of these composites by applying a Monte Carlo, controllable, spatial distribution algorithm. The composites' thermal conductivity and volume resistance were also measured. Tribological tests were conducted using a ball-on-disk reciprocating friction and wear tester. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy were used to analyze the morphologies and elements of worn surfaces. The results showed that AlN/FG{\textendash}PTSC possessed the best thermal properties, which were ascribed to a compact thermal conductive network; thermal conductivity was 88.8\% and 44.8\% greater than the highest value of AlN{\textendash}PTSC and FG{\textendash}PTSC, respectively. The numerical values of thermal conductivity were in a good agreement with experimental results. The optimal electrical tribological properties of AlN/FG{\textendash}PTSC were ascribed to the functions of thermal and electrical properties combined, which could be helpful in abating the arc erosion on friction contacts. {\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We study how the notion of smart contract is interpreted in some of these platforms.

	abstract = {In a few short years the Internet of Things has become an intrinsic part of everyday life, with connected devices included in products created for homes, cars and even medical equipment. But its rapid growth has created several security problems, with respect to the transmission and storage of vast amounts of customers data, across an insecure heterogeneous collection of networks. The Internet of Things is therefore creating a unique set of risk and problems that will affect most households. From breaches in confidentiality, which could allow users to be snooped on, through to failures in integrity, which could lead to consumer data being compromised; devices are presenting many security challenges to which consumers are ill equipped to protect themselves from. Moreover, when this is coupled with the heterogeneous nature of the industry, and the interoperable and scalability problems it becomes apparent that the Internet of Things has created an increased attack surface from which security vulnerabilities may be easily exploited. However, it has been conjectured that blockchain may provide a solution to the Internet of Things security and scalability problems. Because of blockchain's immutability, integrity and scalability, it is possible that its architecture could be used for the storage and transfer of Internet of Things data. Within this paper a cross section of blockchain consensus protocols have been assessed against a requirement framework, to establish each consensus protocols strengths and weaknesses with respect to their potential implementation in an Internet of Things blockchain environment.},

In recent years, blockchain technology has become very trendy and penetrated different domains, mostly due to the popularity of cryptocurrencies. One field where blockchain technology has tremendous potential is healthcare, due to the need for a more patient-centric approach to healthcare systems and to connect disparate systems and increase the accuracy of electronic healthcare records (EHRs). In this systematic review, an analysis of state-of-the-art blockchain research in the field of healthcare is conducted. The aim is to reveal the potential applications of the technology and to highlight the challenges and possible directions of blockchain research in healthcare. First, background information is discussed, followed by a description of the exact methodology used in this paper. Next, an analysis of the results is given, which includes a bibliometric overview, an analysis of gathered data and its properties, and the results of a literature quality assessment. Lastly, there is a discussion of the results from the analysis. The findings indicate that blockchain technology research in healthcare is increasing and it is mostly used for data sharing, managing health records and access control. Other scenarios are very rare. Most research is aimed at presenting novel structural designs in the form of frameworks, architectures or models. Findings also show that technical details about the used blockchain elements are not given in most of the analyzed publications and that most research does not present any prototype implementation or implementation details. Often even with a prototype implementation, no details about blockchain elements are given.},

	abstract = {At the beginning of 2018, there is a growing belief that blockchain technologies constitute a revolutionary innovation in how we transfer value electronically. In that vein, blockchain may be a suitable complement to ontologies to achieve a big part of the vision of the semantic Web by Tim Berners-Lee. We believe that if this complementarity is to be achieved blockchain and ontologies must co-evolve. In this paper, we focus on what and how to engineer models, methods, designs, and implementations for this co-evolution. As a first step in this co-evolution, we propose a conceptual design of a governance ontology represented as meta-data tags to be embedded and instantiated in a smart contract at the blockchain protocol level. We develop this design by examining and analyzing smart contracts from the infamous The DAO experiment on the Ethereum blockchain. We believe there are two contributions of this paper: it serves to inform and implore the blockchain and ontology communities to recognize and collaborate with each other; and it outlines a roadmap for engineering artifacts to bridge the gap between blockchain community focus on protocol-level blockchain interoperability and the ontology community focus on semantic-level interoperability.},

A key property of HLF is its extensibility, and in particular the support for multiple ordering services for building the blockchain. Nonetheless, the version 1.0 was launched in early 2017 without an implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering service. To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a BFT ordering service for HLF on top of the BFT-SMaRt state machine replication/consensus library, implementing also optimizations for wide-area deployment. Our results show that HLF with our ordering service can achieve up to ten thousand transactions per second and write a transaction irrevocably in the blockchain in half a second, even with peers spread in different continents.},

	abstract = {We put forward a new framework that makes it possible to re-write and/or compress the content of any number of blocks in decentralized services exploiting the blockchain technology. As we argue, there are several reasons to prefer an editable blockchain, spanning from the necessity to remove improper content and the possibility to support applications requiring re-writable storage, to "the right to be forgotten".



Our approach generically leverages so-called chameleon hash functions (Krawczyk and Rabin, NDSS '00), which allow to efficiently determine hash collisions given a secret trapdoor information. We detail how to integrate a chameleon hash function in virtually any blockchain-based technology, for both cases where the power of redacting the blockchain content is in the hands of a single trusted entity and where such a capability is distributed among several distrustful parties (as is the case in Bitcoin).

We also report on a proof-of-concept implementation of a redactable blockchain, building on top of Nakamoto's Bitcoin core. The implementation only requires minimal changes to the way current client software interprets information stored in the blockchain and to the current blockchain, block, or transaction structures. Moreover, our experiments show that the overhead imposed by a redactable blockchain is small compared to the case of an immutable one.},

	abstract = {The rapid evolution of the blockchain community has brought together stakeholders from fundamentally different backgrounds: cryptographers, protocol designers, software developers, startup entrepreneurs, corporate executives and investors, academics of various disciplines, and end users. The result is a diverse ecosystem, presently exemplified by the development of a wide range of different blockchain protocols. This raises questions for policy and decision makers: How do different protocols compare? What are their trade-offs? Existing efforts to survey the area reveal a fragmented terminology, and the lack of a unified framework to make the different desirable properties of blockchain protocols explicit. In this paper, we work towards bridging this gap. We evaluate protocols within a five-dimensional design space with the following axes. Optimality: does the protocol achieve its main goals? Stability: are the incentives of its participating agents well-aligned? Efficiency: is its output maximal relative to its use of resources? Robustness: can it cope when its operational assumptions are invalid or perturbed? Persistence: can it recover from catastrophic events? Based on the relevant literature, we organize the properties of existing protocols in subcategories of increasing granularity. The result is a dynamic scheme -- termed the PREStO framework. Its scope is to aid the communication between stakeholders of different backgrounds, including managers and investors, and to identify research challenges and opportunities for blockchain protocols in a systematic way. We illustrate this via use cases and make a first step to understand the blockchain ecosystem through a more comprehensive lens.},

To each of those contributing factors, we outline several attacks, including selfish mining, the 51\% attack, Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, consensus delay (due to selfish behavior or distributed denial-of-service attacks), Blockchain forks, orphaned and stale blocks, block ingestion, wallet thefts, smart contract attacks, and privacy attacks.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04421},
	abstract = {A Coordination Blockchain is a blockchain with the task of coordinating activities of multiple private blockchains. This paper discusses the pros and cons of using Ethereum MainNet, the public Ethereum blockchain, as a Coordination Blockchain. The requirements Ethereum MainNet needs to fulfil to perform this role are discussed within the context of Ethereum Private Sidechains, a private blockchain technology which allows many blockchains to be operated in parallel, and allows atomic crosschain transactions to execute across blockchains. Ethereum MainNet is a permissionless network which aims to offer strong authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation properties, that incentivises good behaviour using crypto economics. This paper demonstrates that Ethereum MainNet does deliver these properties. It then provides a comprehensive review of the features of Ethereum Private Sidechains, with a focus on the potential usage of Coordination Blockchains for these features. Finally, the merits of using Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain are assessed. For Ethereum Private Sidechains, we found that Ethereum MainNet is best suited to storing long term static data that needs to be widely available, such as the Ethereum Registration Authority information. However, due to Ethereum MainNet's probabilistic finality, it is not well suited to information that needs to be available and acted upon immediately, such as the Sidechain Public Keys and Atomic Crosschain Transaction state information that need to be accessible prior to the first atomic crosschain transaction being issued on a sidechain. Although this paper examined the use of Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain within reference to Ethereum Private Sidechains, the discussions and observations of the typical tasks a Coordination blockchain may be expected to perform are applicable more widely to any multi-blockchain system.},

In this paper we present Protean, a general-purpose decentralized computing platform that addresses these limitations by moving from a monolithic execution model, where all participating nodes store all the state and execute every computation, to a modular executionmodel. Protean employs secure specialized modules, called functional units, for building decentralized applications that are currently insecure or impossible to implement with smart contracts. Each functional unit is a distributed system that provides a special-purpose functionality by exposing atomic transactions to the smart-contract developer. Combining these transactions into arbitrarily-defined workflows, developers can build a larger class of decentralized applications, such as provably-secure and fair lotteries or e-voting.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13302},
	abstract = {Stellar is one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization. It adopts a variant of Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), named federated Byzantine agreement (FBA), which generalizes the traditional BFT algorithm to make it more suitable for open-membership blockchains. To this end, FBA introduces a quorum slice concept, which consists of a set of nodes. In FBA, a node can complete one consensus round when it receives specific messages from nodes in a quorum slice appointed by the node. In this study, we analyze FBA, whose security is highly dependent on the structure of quorum slices, and demonstrate that it is not superior to the traditional BFT algorithm in terms of safety and liveness. Then, to analyze the security of the Stellar consensus protocol (SCP), which is a construction for FBA, we investigate the current quorum slices in Stellar. We analyze the structure of quorum slices and measure the influence of each node quantitatively using two metrics, PageRank (PR) and the newly proposed NodeRank (NR). The results show that the Stellar system is significantly centralized. Thereafter, to determine how the centralized structure can have a negative impact on the Stellar system, we study the cascading failure caused by deleting only a few nodes (i.e., validators) in Stellar. We show that all of the nodes in Stellar cannot run SCP if only two nodes fail. To make matters worse, these two nodes are run and controlled by a single organization, the Stellar foundation.},

	abstract = {Consensus mechanisms used by popular distributed ledgers are highly scalable but notoriously inefficient. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols are efficient but far less scalable. Speculative BFT protocols such as Zyzzyva and Zyzzyva5 are efficient and scalable but require a trade-off: Zyzzyva requires only \$3f + 1\$ replicas to tolerate \$f\$ faults, but even a single slow replica will make Zyzzyva fall back to more expensive non-speculative operation. Zyzzyva5 does not require a non-speculative fallback, but requires \$5f + 1\$ replicas in order to tolerate \$f\$ faults. BFT variants using hardware-assisted trusted components can tolerate a greater proportion of faults, but require that every replica have this hardware. We present SACZyzzyva, addressing these concerns: resilience to slow replicas and requiring only \$3f + 1\$ replicas, with only one replica needing an active monotonic counter at any given time. We experimentally evaluate our protocols, demonstrating low latency and high scalability. We prove that SACZyzzyva is optimally robust and that trusted components cannot increase fault tolerance unless they are present in greater than two-thirds of replicas.},

Finally, we survey recent results including how to avoid well-known painpoints in permissionless consensus, and how to apply core ideas behind blockchains to solve consensus in the classical, permissioned setting and meanwhile achieve new properties that are not attained by classical approaches.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and 250 similar alt-coins, embody at their core a blockchain protocol-a mechanism for a distributed network of computational nodes to periodically agree on a set of new transactions. Designing a secure blockchain protocol relies on an open challenge in security, that of designing a highly-scalable agreement protocol open to manipulation by byzantine or arbitrarily malicious nodes. Bitcoin's blockchain agreement protocol exhibits security, but does not scale: it processes 3-7 transactions per second at present, irrespective of the available computation capacity at hand. In this paper, we propose a new distributed agreement protocol for permission-less blockchains called ELASTICO. ELASTICO scales transaction rates almost linearly with available computation for mining: the more the computation power in the network, the higher the number of transaction blocks selected per unit time. ELASTICO is efficient in its network messages and tolerates byzan-tine adversaries of up to one-fourth of the total computational power. Technically, ELASTICO uniformly partitions or parallelizes the mining network (securely) into smaller committees, each of which processes a disjoint set of transactions (or "shards"). While sharding is common in non-byzantine settings, ELASTICO is the first candidate for a secure sharding protocol with presence of byzantine adversaries. Our scalability experiments on Amazon EC2 with up to 1, 600 nodes confirm ELASTICO's theoretical scaling properties.},

This work presents OmniLedger, the first scale-out distributed ledger that can preserve long-term security under permissionless operation. OmniLedger ensures strong correctness and security by using a bias-resistant public randomness protocol to choose large statistically representative shards to process trans-actions, and by introducing an efficient cross-shard commit pro-tocol to handle transactions affecting multiple shards atomically. In addition, OmniLedger optimizes performance via scalable intra-shard parallel transaction processing, ledger pruning via collectively-signed state blocks, and optional low-latency " trust-but-verify " validation of low-value transactions. Evaluation of our working experimental prototype shows that OmniLedger's throughput scales linearly in the number of validators available, supporting Visa-level workloads and beyond, while confirming typical transactions in under two seconds.},

In this paper, we propose an extension to existing BFT architectures that increases performance for the default number of replicas by optimizing the resource utilization of their execution stages. Our approach executes a request on only a selected subset of replicas, using a selector component co-located with each replica. As this leads to divergent replica states, a selector on-demand updates outdated objects on the local replica prior to processing a request. Our evaluation shows that with each replica executing only a part of all requests, the overall performance of a Byzantine fault-tolerant NFS can be almost doubled; our prototype even outperforms unreplicated NFS.},

We have two main contributions. First, we present a highly scalable sharding framework for blockchain. This framework takes an arbitrary number of single chains and transforms them into the blocklattice data structure, enabling high scalability and low transaction confirmation latency with asymptotically optimal communication overhead. Second, we propose a single-chain protocol based on our novel verifiable random function and a new Byzantine agreement that achieves high decentralization and low latency.},

	abstract = {Light clients, also known as Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients, are nodes which only download a small portion of the data in a blockchain, and use indirect means to verify that a given chain is valid. Typically, instead of validating block data, they assume that the chain favoured by the blockchain's consensus algorithm only contains valid blocks, and that the majority of block producers are honest. By allowing such clients to receive fraud proofs generated by fully validating nodes that show that a block violates the protocol rules, and combining this with probabilistic sampling techniques to verify that all of the data in a block actually is available to be downloaded, we can eliminate the honest-majority assumption, and instead make much weaker assumptions about a minimum number of honest nodes that rebroadcast data. Fraud and data availability proofs are key to enabling on-chain scaling of blockchains (e.g. via sharding or bigger blocks) while maintaining a strong assurance that on-chain data is available and valid. We present, implement, and evaluate a novel fraud and data availability proof system.},

Next, a Bayesian VAR model for the macroeconomy, with priors on the steady states, is augmented with these financial variables and estimated using Swedish data for 1989{\textendash}2015. The results support three conclusions. First, the financial system is important and the strength of the results is dependent on identification, with the financial variables accounting for 10{\textendash}25 \% of the forecast error variance of Swedish GDP growth. Second, the suggested model produces an earlier signal regarding the probability of recession, compared to a model without financial variables. Third, the model{\textquoteright}s forecasts for the deep downturn in 2008 and 2009, conditional on the development of the financial variables, outperform a macro-model that lacks financial variables. Furthermore, this improvement in modelling Swedish GDP growth during the financial crisis does not come at the expense of unconditional predictive power. Taken together, the results suggest that the proposed model presents an accessible possibility to analyse the macro-financial linkages and the GDP developments, especially during a financial crisis.},

The paper aims to capture the rigorous cross-domain understanding of decentralization and its most important features, and to map the commonalities and differences between it and some closely related concepts such as distribution, disintermediation and peer-to-peer (P2P). Across all domains, decentralization appears to be used as a solution to problems requiring non-trivial coordination across heterogeneous stakeholders. Blockchain-mediated decentralization appears to have unique characteristics reflecting an idiosyncratic set of authority-related values prevalent in so-called {\textquoteleft}crypto{\textquoteright} online communities. Within blockchain space, the article argues against the binary positioning of {\textquoteleft}decentralization{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}centralization{\textquoteright}, proposing a dialectical approach and arguing that a system{\textquoteright}s authority allocation is a quality positioned on a spectrum between purely decentralized and completely centralized, noting how a blockchain set-up could simultaneously both have facets that are significantly centralized and others that are not. The authors document their systematic review findings and propose a framework for understanding blockchain-mediated decentralization, suggesting a definition, and outlining new directions for further human-centric research into distributed ledger technologies and for designing decentralized ecosystems.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

This can largely be attributed to free-market ideology, which has spread the belief that leaving finance to its own devices would provide the best possible mechanism for allocating savings. The latest financial crisis has sparked the beginnings of a new awareness on this point, but it is far from having led to an improved understanding of the role of the financial institutions. For many people, finance remains more an enemy to be resisted than an instrument to be intelligently exploited. Its institutions, which issue and circulate money, play an important role in the working of the real economy that it would be imprudent to neglect. The allocation of savings, but also the level of activity and the growth rate depend on it. In this book, the authors carefully analyse the close links between money, finance and the real economy. In the process, they show why today the existence of a substantial potential of saving, instead of being an opportunity for the world economy, could threaten it with 'secular stagnation'.--Publisher description},

More specifically, as the size of a deployment---i.e., degree of replication---increases, the protocol performance greatly decreases. There is not much experimental evidence for this decay in practice, however, notably for larger system sizes, e.g., beyond a handful of machines. In this paper we execute agreement protocols on up to 100 machines and observe on their performance decay. We consider well-known agreement protocols part of mature systems, such as Apache ZooKeeper, etcd, and BFT-Smart, as well as a chain and a novel ring-based agreement protocol which we implement ourselves. We provide empirical evidence that current agreement protocols execute gracefully on 100 machines. We observe that throughput decay is initially sharp (consistent with previous observations); but intriguingly---as each system grows beyond a few tens of replicas---the decay dampens. For chain- and ring-based replication, this decay is slower than for the other systems. The positive takeaway from our evaluation is that mature agreement protocol implementations can sustain out-of-the-box 300 to 500 requests per second when executing on 100 replicas on a wide-area public cloud platform. Chain- and ring-based replication can reach between 4K and 11K (up to 20x improvements) depending on the fault assumptions.},

	abstract = {Byzantine reliable broadcast is a powerful primitive that allows a set of processes to agree on a message from a designated sender, even if some processes (including the sender) are Byzantine. Existing broadcast protocols for this setting scale poorly, as they typically build on quorum systems with strong intersection guarantees, which results in linear per-process communication and computation complexity. We generalize the Byzantine reliable broadcast abstraction to the probabilistic setting, allowing each of its properties to be violated with a fixed, arbitrarily small probability. We leverage these relaxed guarantees in a protocol where we replace quorums with stochastic samples. Compared to quorums, samples are significantly smaller in size, leading to a more scalable design. We obtain the first Byzantine reliable broadcast protocol with logarithmic per-process communication and computation complexity. We conduct a complete and thorough analysis of our protocol, deriving bounds on the probability of each of its properties being compromised. During our analysis, we introduce a novel general technique we call adversary decorators. Adversary decorators allow us to make claims about the optimal strategy of the Byzantine adversary without having to make any additional assumptions. We also introduce Threshold Contagion, a model of message propagation through a system with Byzantine processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal analysis of a probabilistic broadcast protocol in the Byzantine fault model. We show numerically that practically negligible failure probabilities can be achieved with realistic security parameters.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06271},
	abstract = {Reliable broadcast is a communication primitive guaranteeing, intuitively, that all processes in a distributed system deliver the same set of messages. The reason why this primitive is appealing is twofold: (i) we can implement it deterministically in a completely asynchronous environment, unlike stronger primitives like consensus and total-order broadcast, and yet (ii) reliable broadcast is powerful enough to implement important applications like payment systems. The problem we tackle in this paper is that of dynamic reliable broadcast, i.e., enabling processes to join or leave the system. This property is desirable for long-lived applications (aiming to be highly available), yet has been precluded in previous asynchronous reliable broadcast protocols. We study this property in a general adversarial (i.e., Byzantine) environment. We introduce the first specification of a dynamic Byzantine reliable broadcast (DBRB) primitive that is amenable to an asynchronous implementation. We then present an algorithm implementing this specification in an asynchronous network. Our DBRB algorithm ensures that if any correct process in the system broadcasts a message, then every correct process delivers that message unless it leaves the system. Moreover, if a correct process delivers a message, then every correct process that has not expressed its will to leave the system delivers that message. We assume that more than \$2/3\$ of processes in the system are correct at all times, which is tight in our context. We also show that if only one process in the system can fail---and it can fail only by crashing---then it is impossible to implement a stronger primitive, ensuring that if any correct process in the system broadcasts or delivers a message, then every correct process in the system delivers that message---including those that leave.},

	abstract = {The public is worried about election security {\textemdash} understandably, and perhaps more today than in recent memory. The news teems with reports of possible election interference by foreign powers, of unauthorized voting on the one hand and voter disenfranchisement on the other, and of technological failures calling into question the integrity of elections in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. Some have advocated {\textquotedblleft}voting over the Internet{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}voting on the blockchain{\textquotedblright} as promising ways to increase election security. This paper examines such claims, and finds them both wanting and misleading. Even taking into account the many imperfections of election systems in use today, Internetand blockchain-based voting would drastically increase the potential for catastrophic, undetectable, nationscale election failures. The intuitive appeal of online voting arises partly from the perceived convenience and accessibility of voting from a computer or smartphone. But studies have been inconclusive, showing that online voting may have little to no effect on turnout in practice, and sometimes even increase disenfranchisement.1 More importantly: any increased turnout associated with Internetor blockchain-based voting would come at the pyrrhic cost of losing any credible assurance that votes have been counted as *Researcher, MIT Media Lab, Digital Currency Initiative; J.D.

	abstract = {We address the problem of online payments, where users can transfer funds among themselves. We introduce Astro, a system solving this problem efficiently in a decentralized, deterministic, and completely asynchronous manner. Astro builds on the insight that consensus is unnecessary to prevent double-spending. Instead of consensus, Astro relies on a weaker primitive---Byzantine reliable broadcast---enabling a simpler and more efficient implementation than consensus-based payment systems. In terms of efficiency, Astro executes a payment by merely broadcasting a message. The distinguishing feature of Astro is that it can maintain performance robustly, i.e., remain unaffected by a fraction of replicas being compromised or slowed down by an adversary. Our experiments on a public cloud network show that Astro can achieve near-linear scalability in a sharded setup, going from \$10K\$ payments/sec (2 shards) to \$20K\$ payments/sec (4 shards). In a nutshell, Astro can match VISA-level average payment throughput, and achieves a \$5{\textbackslash}times\$ improvement over a state-of-the-art consensus-based solution, while exhibiting sub-second \$95{\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$ percentile latency.},

	abstract = {The price of anarchy, defined as the ratio of the worst-case objective function value of a Nash equilibrium of a game and that of an optimal outcome, quantifies the inefficiency of selfish behavior. Remarkably good bounds on this measure are known for a wide range of application domains. However, such bounds are meaningful only if a game's participants successfully reach a Nash equilibrium. This drawback motivates inefficiency bounds that apply more generally to weaker notions of equilibria, such as mixed Nash equilibria and correlated equilibria, and to sequences of outcomes generated by natural experimentation strategies, such as successive best responses and simultaneous regret-minimization. We establish a general and fundamental connection between the price of anarchy and its seemingly more general relatives. First, we identify a {\textquotedblleft}canonical sufficient condition{\textquotedblright} for an upper bound on the price of anarchy of pure Nash equilibria, which we call a smoothness argument. Second, we prove an {\textquotedblleft}extension theorem{\textquotedblright}: every bound on the price of anarchy that is derived via a smoothness argument extends automatically, with no quantitative degradation in the bound, to mixed Nash equilibria, correlated equilibria, and the average objective function value of every outcome sequence generated by no-regret learners. Smoothness arguments also have automatic implications for the inefficiency of approximate equilibria, for bicriteria bounds, and, under additional assumptions, for polynomial-length best-response sequences. Third, we prove that in congestion games, smoothness arguments are {\textquotedblleft}complete{\textquotedblright} in a proof-theoretic sense: despite their automatic generality, they are guaranteed to produce optimal worst-case upper bounds on the price of anarchy.},

	abstract = {Accountability is becoming increasingly required in today's distributed systems. Indeed, accountability allows not only to detect faults but also to build provable evidence about the misbehaving participants of a distributed system. There exists a number of solutions to enforce accountability in distributed systems, among which PeerReview is the only solution that is not specific to a given application and that does not rely on any special hardware. However, this protocol is not resilient to selfish nodes, i.e., nodes that aim at maximising their benefit without contributing their fair share to the system. Our objective in this paper is to provide a software solution to enforce accountability on any underlying application in presence of selfish nodes. To tackle this problem, we propose the FullReview protocol. FullReview relies on game theory by embedding incentives that force nodes to stick to the protocol. We theoretically prove that our protocol is a Nash equilibrium, i.e., that nodes do not have any interest in deviating from it. Furthermore, we practically evaluate FullReview by deploying it for enforcing accountability in two applications: (1) SplitStream, an efficient multicast protocol, and (2) Onion routing, the most widely used anonymous communication protocol. Performance evaluation shows that FullReview effectively detects faults in presence of selfish nodes while incurring a small overhead compared to PeerReview and scaling as PeerReview.},

Instead, it is imperative that the service be structured so that nodes--which are administered by different, potentially selfish entities--have an incentive to help sustain it. Indeed, such issues are not imaginary: ample evidence suggests that a large number of peers will free-ride or deviate from the assigned protocol if it is in their interest to do so (e.g., [3,9,16,21]).},

At the core of BAR-B is an asynchronous replicated state machine that provides the customary safety and liveness guarantees despite nodes exhibiting both Byzantine and rational behaviors.

Our experimental evaluation shows that SieveQ improves existing replicated-firewalls resilience in the presence of corrupted messages by faulty nodes.

	abstract = {Abstract. This paper establishes the first theorem relating resilience, time complexity and authentication in distributed computing. We study consensus algorithms that tolerate Byzantine failures and arbitrary long periods of asynchrony. We measure the ability of processes to reach a consensus decision in a minimal number of rounds of information exchange, as a function of (a) their ability to use authentication and (b) the number of actual process failures in those rounds, as well as of (c) the total number of failures tolerated and (d) the system constellation. The constellations considered distinguish different roles of processes, such that we can directly derive a meaningful bound on the time complexity of implementing robust general services using several replicas coordinated through consensus. To prove our theorem, we establish certain lower bounds and we give algorithms that match these bounds. The algorithms are all variants of the same generic asynchronous Byzantine consensus algorithm, which is interesting in its own right.},

However, the majority of the previous studies have focused on the technical aspects, and overlooked blockchain investigation from a managerial perspective. In this paper, based on platform-ecosystem, transaction cost economics, and open-source literature, we contrast and compare blockchain-based platforms and centralized platforms; in other words, decentralized versus centralized governance modes. We base our conceptual analysis on three dimensions{\textemdash}transaction cost, cost of technology, and community involvement{\textemdash}, exploring the conditions under which blockchain-based platforms are more advantageous than centralized platforms. We first compare gains from lower opportunism and uncertainty costs thanks to protocols and smart contracts in blockchain technology versus the costs of higher coordination and complexity of (re)writing those contracts. Second, we compare the gains from immutability and transparency in blockchain-based platforms versus the technological costs of verification and storage of a distributed ledger. Finally, we compare intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the communities around centralized and blockchain-based platforms in the short and medium term.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the collection, processing, and analysis of various forms of data including the personal data from billions of objects to generate valuable knowledge, making more innovative services for its stakeholders. Yet, this paradigm continuously suffers from numerous security and privacy concerns mainly due to its massive scale, distributed nature, and scarcity of resources towards the edge of IoT networks. Interestingly, blockchain based techniques offer strong countermeasures to protect data from tampering while supporting the distributed nature of the IoT. However, the enormous amount of energy consumption required to verify each block of data make it difficult to use with resource-constrained IoT devices and with real-time IoT applications. Nevertheless, it can expose the privacy of the stakeholders due to its public ledger system even though it secures data from alterations. Edge computing approaches suggest a potential alternative to centralized processing in order to populate real-time applications at the edge and to reduce privacy concerns associated with cloud computing. Hence, this paper suggests the novel privacy preserving blockchain called TrustChain which combines the power of blockchains with trust concepts to eliminate issues associated with traditional blockchain architectures. This work investigates how TrustChain can be deployed in the edge computing environment with different levels of absorptions to eliminate delays and privacy concerns associated with centralized processing and to preserve the resources in IoT networks.},

We approach the problem of digital identity starting from a human rights perspective, with a primary focus on identity systems in the developed world. We assert that individual persons must be allowed to manage their personal information in a multitude of different ways in different contexts and that to do so, each individual must be able to create multiple unrelated identities. Therefore, we first define a set of fundamental constraints that digital identity systems must satisfy to preserve and promote privacy as required for individual autonomy. With these constraints in mind, we then propose a decentralised, standards-based approach, using a combination of distributed ledger technology and thoughtful regulation, to facilitate many-to-many relationships among providers of key services. Our proposal for digital identity differs from others in its approach to trust in that we do not seek to bind credentials to each other or to a mutually trusted authority to achieve strong non-transferability. Because the system does not implicitly encourage its users to maintain a single aggregated identity that can potentially be constrained or reconstructed against their interests, individuals and organisations are free to embrace the system and share in its benefits.},

We then use the gathered information to verify the conjecture that the propagation delay in the network is the primary cause for blockchain forks. Blockchain forks should be avoided as they are symptomatic for inconsistencies among the replicas in the network. We then show what can be achieved by pushing the current protocol to its limit with unilateral changes to the client{\textquoteright}s behavior.},

	doi = {10.1145/3293611.3331589},
	abstract = {Many blockchain-based algorithms, such as Bitcoin, implement a decentralized asset transfer system, often referred to as a cryptocurrency. As stated in the original paper by Nakamoto, at the heart of these systems lies the problem of preventing double-spending; this is usually solved by achieving consensus on the order of transfers among the participants. In this paper, we treat the asset transfer problem as a concurrent object and determine its consensus number, showing that consensus is, in fact, not necessary to prevent double-spending. We first consider the problem as defined by Nakamoto, where only a single process---the account owner---can withdraw from each account. Safety and liveness need to be ensured for correct account owners, whereas misbehaving account owners might be unable to perform transfers. We show that the consensus number of an asset transfer object is \$1\$. We then consider a more general \$k\$-shared asset transfer object where up to \$k\$ processes can atomically withdraw from the same account, and show that this object has consensus number \$k\$. We establish our results in the context of shared memory with benign faults, allowing us to properly understand the level of difficulty of the asset transfer problem. We also translate these results in the message passing setting with Byzantine players, a model that is more relevant in practice. In this model, we describe an asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant asset transfer implementation that is both simpler and more efficient than state-of-the-art consensus-based solutions. Our results are applicable to both the permissioned (private) and permissionless (public) setting, as normally their differentiation is hidden by the abstractions on top of which our algorithms are based.},

The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and datadriven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this survey, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of incentivized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-ofthe-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review on the strategy adoption for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey on the emerging applications of the blockchain networks in a wide range of areas. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.},

The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which is unavailable. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. In particular, we systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. We draw insights into, among other things, vulnerability root causes, attack consequences, and defense capabilities, which shed light on future research directions.},

We responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to core Ethereum developers; the corresponding countermeasures to our attack where incorporated into the v1.9.0 release of Geth. Our false friends attack exploits the Kademlia-inspired peer discovery logic used by Geth and enables a low-resource eclipsing of long-running, remote victim nodes. An adversary only needs two hosts in distinct /24 subnets to launch the eclipse, which can then be leveraged to filter the victim's view of the Blockchain. We discuss fundamental properties of Geth's node discovery logic that enable the false friends attack, as well as proposed and implemented countermeasures.},

	abstract = {The various applications using Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) or blockchains, have led to the introduction of a new `marketplace' where multiple types of digital assets may be exchanged. As each blockchain is designed to support specific types of assets and transactions, and no blockchain will prevail, the need to perform interblockchain transactions is already pressing. In this work we examine the fundamental problem of interoperable and interconnected blockchains. In particular, we begin by introducing the Multi-Distributed Ledger Objects (MDLO), which is the result of aggregating multiple Distributed Ledger Objects -- DLO (a DLO is a formalization of the blockchain) and that supports append and get operations of records (e.g., transactions) in them from multiple clients concurrently. Next, we define the AtomicAppends problem, which emerges when the exchange of digital assets between multiple clients may involve appending records in more than one DLO. Specifically, AtomicAppend requires that either all records will be appended on the involved DLOs or none. We examine the solvability of this problem assuming rational and risk-averse clients that may fail by crashing, and under different client utility and append models, timing models, and client failure scenarios. We show that for some cases the existence of an intermediary is necessary for the problem solution.

This theorem was stated and proved assuming that {\textquoteleft}consistency{\textquoteright} refers to atomic consistency. However, multiple consistency models exist and atomic consistency is located at the strongest edge of that spectrum. Many distributed services deployed in cloud platforms should be highly available and scalable. Network partitions may arise in those deployments and should be tolerated. One way of dealing with CAP constraints consists in relaxing consistency. Therefore, it is interesting to explore the set of consistency models not supported in an available and partition-tolerant service (CAP-constrained models). Other weaker consistency models could be maintained when scalable services are deployed in partitionable systems (CAP-free models). Three contributions arise: (i) multiple other CAP-constrained models are identified, (ii) a borderline between CAP-constrained and CAP-free models is set and (iii) a hierarchy of consistency models depending on their strength and convergence is built.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01980},
	abstract = {Consistency properties provided by most key-value stores can be classified into sequential consistency and eventual consistency. The former is easier to program with but suffers from lower performance whereas the latter suffers from potential anomalies while providing higher performance. We focus on the problem of what a designer should do if he/she has an algorithm that works correctly with sequential consistency but is faced with an underlying key-value store that provides a weaker consistency. We propose a detect-rollback based approach: The designer identifies a correctness predicate, say \$P\$, and continues to run the protocol, as our system monitors \$P\$. If \$P\$ is violated (because of weaker consistency), the system rolls back and resumes the computation at a state where \$P\$ holds. We evaluate this approach with graph-based applications running on the Voldemort key-value store. Our experiments with deployment on Amazon AWS EC2 instances shows that using eventual consistency with monitoring can provide a \$50{\textbackslash}\%\$ -- \$80{\textbackslash}\%\$ increase in throughput when compared with sequential consistency. We also observe that the overhead of the monitoring itself was low (typically less than \$4{\textbackslash}\%\$) and the latency of detecting violations was small. In particular, in a scenario designed to intentionally cause a large number of violations, more than \$99.9{\textbackslash}\%\$ of violations were detected in less than 50 milliseconds in regional networks, and in less than 3 seconds in global networks. We find that for some applications, frequent rollback can cause the program using eventual consistency to effectively {\textbackslash}textit\{stall\}. We propose alternate mechanisms for dealing with re-occurring rollbacks. Overall, for applications considered in this paper, we find that even with rollback, eventual consistency provides better performance than using sequential consistency.},

	abstract = {A long-standing promise of Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) replication is to maintain the service correctness despite the presence of malicious failures. The key challenge here is how to ensure replicas fail independently, i.e., avoid that a single attack compromises more than f replicas at once. The obvious answer for this is the use of diverse replicas, but most works in BFT simply assume such diversity without supporting mechanisms to substantiate this assumption. Lazarus is a control plane for managing the deployment and execution of diverse replicas in BFT systems. Lazarus continuously monitors the current vulnerabilities of the system replicas (reported in security feeds such as NVD and ExploitDB) and employs a metric to measure the risk of having a common weakness in the replicas set. If such risk is high, the set of replicas is reconfigured. Our evaluation shows that the devised strategy reduces the number of executions where the system becomes compromised and that our prototype supports the execution of full-fledged BFT systems in diverse configurations with 17 OS versions, reaching a performance close to a homogeneous bare-metal setup.},

The cyber-physical systems (CPS) monitor and control the things from the distance. As a result, the concepts of dependability and security get deeply intertwined. The increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. This paper summarizes state-of-the-art of existing work on anomaly detection, fault-tolerance and self-healing, and adds a number of other methods applicable to achieve resilience in an IoT. We particularly focus on non-intrusive methods ensuring data integrity in the network. Furthermore, this paper presents the main challenges in building a resilient IoT for CPS which is crucial in the era of smart CPS with enhanced connectivity (an excellent example of such a system is connected autonomous vehicles). It further summarizes our solutions, work-in-progress and future work to this topic to enable "Trustworthy IoT for CPS". Finally, this framework is illustrated on a selected use case: A smart sensor infrastructure in the transport domain.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10067},
	abstract = {This paper introduces Flexible BFT, a new approach for BFT consensus solution design revolving around two pillars, stronger resilience and diversity. The first pillar, stronger resilience, involves a new fault model called alive-but-corrupt faults. Alive-but-corrupt replicas may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol in an attempt to break safety of the protocol. However, if they cannot break safety, they will not try to prevent liveness of the protocol. Combining alive-but-corrupt faults into the model, Flexible BFT is resilient to higher corruption levels than possible in a pure Byzantine fault model. The second pillar, diversity, designs consensus solutions whose protocol transcript is used to draw different commit decisions under diverse beliefs. With this separation, the same Flexible BFT solution supports synchronous and asynchronous beliefs, as well as varying resilience threshold combinations of Byzantine and alive-but-corrupt faults. At a technical level, Flexible BFT achieves the above results using two new ideas. First, it introduces a synchronous BFT protocol in which only the commit step requires to know the network delay bound and thus replicas execute the protocol without any synchrony assumption. Second, it introduces a notion called Flexible Byzantine Quorums by dissecting the roles of different quorums in existing consensus protocols.},

	abstract = {Since the inception of Bitcoin, the distributed and database community has shown interest in the design of efficient blockchain systems. At the core of any blockchain application is a Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol that helps a set of replicas reach an agreement on the order of a client request. Initial blockchain applications (like Bitcoin) attain very low throughput and are computationally expensive. Hence, researchers moved towards the design of permissioned blockchain systems that employ classical BFT protocols, such as PBFT, to reach consensus. However, existing permissioned blockchain systems still attain low throughputs (of the order 10K txns/s). As a result, existing works blame this low throughput on the associated BFT protocol and expend resources in developing optimizes protocols. We believe such blames only depict a one-sided story. In specific, we raise a simple question: can a well-crafted system based on a classical BFT protocol outperform a modern protocol? We show that designing such a well-crafted system is possible and illustrate cases where a three-phase protocol can outperform a single-phase protocol. Further, we dissect a permissioned blockchain system and state several factors that affect its performance. We also design a high-throughput yielding permissioned blockchain system, ResilientDB, that employs parallel pipelines to balance tasks at a replica, and provides guidelines for future designs.},

Our second attack shows that a malicious adversary could use a bribery attack to fork the ALGORAND chain very easily also. Furthermore, we show that the celebrated Byzantine Agreement component in ALGORAND is not necessary. The Byzantine Agreement is the most expensive part and one of the most innovative parts in the ALGORAND protocol. It is used to avoid forks in ALGORAND.

While proof-of-work consensus dominates the space, several new cryptocurrencies employ alternative consensus, such as proof-of-stake in which block minting opportunities are based on monetary ownership. A core criticism of proof-of-stake revolves around it being less egalitarian by making the rich richer, as opposed to proof-of-work in which everyone can contribute equally according to their computational power. In this paper, we give the first quantitative definition of a cryptocurrency{\textquoteright}s egalitarianism. Based on our definition, we measure the egalitarianism of popular cryptocurrencies that (may or may not) employ ASIC-resistance, among them Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. Our simulations show, as expected, that ASIC-resistance increases a cryptocurrency{\textquoteright}s egalitarianism. We also measure the egalitarianism of a stake-based protocol, Ouroboros, and a hybrid proof-of-stake/proof-of-work cryptocurrency, Decred. We show that stake-based cryptocurrencies, under correctly selected parameters, can be perfectly egalitarian, perhaps contradicting folklore belief.},

There exist equilibria with forks, leading to orphaned blocks and persistent divergence between chains. We also show how forks can be generated by information delays and software upgrades. Last we identify negative externalities implying that equilibrium investment in computing capacity is excessive.},

The runtime performance of these protocols is most commonly assessed in the absence of processor faults and is usually good in that case. However, in some protocols faulty processors can significantly degrade performance, limiting the practical utility of these protocols in adversarial environments. This paper demonstrates the extent of performance degradation possible in some existing protocols that do satisfy liveness and that do perform well absent Byzantine faults. We propose a new performanceoriented correctness criterion that requires a consistent level of performance, even when the system exhibits Byzantine faults.

Byzantine processes seek to inflict maximum damage to the system, while rational processes best-respond to maximise their expected net gains. Our second contribution is to derive conditions under which consensus properties are satisfied or not in equilibrium. When the majority threshold is lower than the proportion of Byzantine processes, invalid blocks are accepted in equilibrium. When the majority threshold is large, equilibrium can involve coordination failures , in which no block is ever accepted. However, when the cost of accepting invalid blocks is large, there exists an equilibrium in which blocks are accepted iff they are valid.},

One domain is an application in cyber-physical systems (CPSs), e.g., as a building block for the (Industrial) Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0. In this regard, various use cases and designs have been proposed that seek to leverage the desirable properties blockchain technologies seem to offer. While many of the principles behind blockchain have actually been studied under the veil of Byzantine fault tolerance for decades, some approaches, such as relying on game-theoretic incentives and proof-of-work (PoW), are not yet fully understood. This knowledge gap can leave both practitioners and researchers in a difficult position regarding a possible application of such technologies, as it is often unclear what guarantees and characteristics a particular blockchain design actually achieves. This work-in-progress paper provides an overview of blockchain security research, outlines system designs that are likely to exhibit vulnerabilities, and provides examples of potentially insecure proposals in the field of CPSs that employ such designs.},

This consensus's working and its comparison with other protocols that were earlier proposed are analyzed here. Also, hyperledger an open-source project by Linux Foundation which includes implementing the concept of practical byzantine fault tolerance and also a platform where various other consensus protocols and blockchain applications can be deployed in a plug and play manner is also being discussed here.

One of the main issues in consensus research is the many different variants of the problem that exist as well as the various ways the problem behaves when different setup, computational assumptions and network models are considered. In this work we perform a systematization of knowledge in the landscape of consensus research starting with the original formulation in the early 1980s up to the present blockchain-based new class of consensus protocols.

	abstract = {State machine replication (SMR) in distributed computing is fundamental when employing redundancy of storage to facilitate fault-tolerance. It aims at maintaining the consistency of the state of several copies of a -possibly dynamic- distributed object, thus, providing increased availability. At the same time, it strives to reduce the impact on the system{\textquoteright}s performance. Research on cloud systems has significantly benefited from accumulated knowledge on SMR to quickly progress towards making cloud services efficient and reliable. Two established paradigms providing SMR are consensus and virtual synchrony (VS). Consensus-based SMR algorithms are widely studied and used, and well understood. Recently, Byzantine-tolerant SMR was proposed as an alternative to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) paradigm of block ordering in blockchains. This is because it is suggested to overcome the poor performance scalability of PoW and avoid the high energy consumptions. On the other hand, systems that provide the VS property are today directed towards high-speed cloud services.
Systems implementing SMR provide guarantees based on assumptions like bounded churn rates, bounded replica failures, failure-free probabilistic error de- tection mechanisms, or that system variables are started in a consistent state. If these are, even temporarily, violated due to the occurrence of transient faults, then this may corrupt the state of a single or multiple replicas, including its program coun- ters. Subsequently, this leads the system to an arbitrary state, causing it to become possibly unavailable, unless there is human intervention. Self-stabilizing systems enhance existing fault tolerant systems to allow them to automatically recover from transient failures. In this way, and combined with other fault-tolerance techniques, self-stabilization provides a comprehensive and robust fault-resilience and recovery strategy.
This thesis proposes self-stabilizing algorithmic solutions with proven guarantees to several SMR-related problems. In this framework, we initially present the first practically-self-stabilizing VS-based SMR for a static crash-prone replica set. We then introduce dynamicity in the membership of the replica set, and provide a modular self-stabilizing reconfiguration scheme that can lead to self-stabilizing reconfigurable SMR (based on either VS or consensus). We then address the more challenging failure model of Byzantine faults, and propose a malicious-tolerant self-stabilizing SMR algorithm based on implementable failure detectors. The thesis also bears several by-products such as a self-stabilizing counter that can be incremented in distributed fashion, and novel design and proof techniques. Considered together, the three results cover a significant gap towards achieving self-stabilizing versions of SMR-based blockchain frameworks or of reconfigurable Byzantine-tolerant SMRs.},

This separation yields two fundamental and practically significant advantages over previous architectures. First, it reduces replication costs because the new architecture can tolerate faults in up to half of the state machine replicas that execute requests. Previous systems can tolerate faults in at most a third of the combined agreement/state machine replicas. Second, separating agreement from execution allows a general privacy firewall architecture to protect confidentiality through replication. In contrast, replication in previous systems hurts confidentiality because exploiting the weakest replica can be sufficient to compromise the system. We have constructed a prototype and evaluated it running both microbenchmarks and an NFS server. Overall, we find that the architecture adds modest latencies to unreplicated systems and that its performance is competitive with existing Byzantine fault tolerant systems.},

	abstract = {Intrusion Tolerance www.computer.org/security/ ? ieee seCurity \& PrivaCy 19 quently, this architecture supports solutions both with outsider threats-protecting a facility from the Inter-net-and insider threats-protecting a highly critical host from other hosts in the same physical facility by locating them in different LANs. A Crutial information switch protects each LAN (see Figure 1). A CIS provides two basic services: The protection service ensures that the incoming and outgoing traffic from the LAN satisfies the security policy of the organization managing the LAN. The communication service supports secure communication between the CIS and, ultimately, between LANs. It provides secure channels and multicast between CISs. In this article, we focus on the protection service. A CIS is a distributed protection device with the following main characteristics: It resembles a distributed firewall 3 because organizations {\textbullet} {\textbullet} {\textbullet} can deploy it not only at the network border but also inside the network to protect critical equipment. It uses a rich access-control model that considers the involvement of different organizations and lets the access control rules depend on context information. 4 It's intrusion-tolerant 5-that is, it operates correctly even if an attacker intrudes in some of its components. Its objective is to withstand a high degree of hostility from the environment. Researchers have proposed other intrusion-tolerant services (a brief survey is available elsewhere 6); however , the CIS design differs from those services in two essential ways. First, a firewall-like component has to be transparent to the protocols that pass through it, so it cannot modify these protocols to obtain intrusion tolerance. Second, internal CIS intrusion-tolerance mechanisms must be transparent to recipient nodes, because such nodes can't protect themselves from malicious messages forwarded by faulty CIS components not satisfying the security policy. {\textbullet} {\textbullet} C ritical infrastructure protection is harder to address than information and communication technology (ICT) protection because of these infrastructures' interconnection complexity, which can lead to various kinds of problems. Consider the power grid, in which geographically dispersed production sites distribute power through different voltage level stations (from higher to lower voltage) until energy eventually flows into our houses. Both the production and distribution sites are typically controlled by supervisory control and data-acquisition (SCada) systems, which are remotely connected to supervision centers and to the corporate networks (intranets) of the companies managing the infrastructures. The intranets are linked to the Internet to facilitate, for example, communication with power regulators and end clients. These links create a path for external attackers. Operators access SCada systems remotely for maintenance operations, and sometimes equipment suppliers keep links to the systems through modems. From the viewpoint of keeping the system working, this is all a good idea, but from a security perspective, this looks like a recipe for serious problems. 1 This conclusion is far from speculation: a few years ago, an Internet worm entered a nuclear plant's supervision systems through a supplier's modem, which almost caused a disaster. 2 On a more positive side, critical infrastructure companies and governments have been showing a high level of concern about this state of affairs, and have been pushing several security measures. However, a careful reading of the legion of guidelines being produced (for example, US National Institute of Standards and Technology specification 800-82 3) shows a common trend that we can summarize in a couple of ideas: critical infrastructure protection is a network security problem that should be handled using secure communication protocols and perimeter protection through firewalls. These mechanisms are a first level of protection with undeniable utility and importance. However, they put critical infrastructure protection at the level of ICT security, which is inadequate because of these infrastructures' criticality and societal relevance. Moreover, firewalls are known to be vulnerable to intrusions and denial-of-service attacks. The US National Vulnerability database reported 9 vulnerabilities that might lead to intrusions in commercial firewalls in 2005, 15 in 2006, and again 15 in 2007. The total number of vulnerabilities reported for these three years is 79. We clearly need more than classical prevention security mechanisms such as firewalls. However, when building new solutions, developers must recognize that critical infrastructures feature numerous legacy subsystems and noncomputational components, such as controllers , sensors, and actuators, which can't be modified for operational reasons or others, for several years to come. In addition, a company's main concern is keeping its critical infrastructure working at the expected level of service. Security mechanisms that stand in the way of operation are unacceptable.},

	abstract = {Broadcast protocols are a fundamental building block for implementing replication in fault-tolerant distributed systems. This paper addresses secure service replication in an asynchronous environment with a static set of servers, where a malicious adversary may corrupt up to a threshold of servers and controls the network. We develop a formal model using concepts from modern cryptography, give modular definitions for several broadcast problems, including reliable, atomic, and secure causal broadcast, and present protocols implementing them. Reliable broadcast is a basic primitive, also known as the Byzantine generals problem, providing agreement on a delivered message. Atomic broadcast imposes additionally a total order on all delivered messages. We present a randomized atomic broadcast protocol based on a new, efficient multi-valued asynchronous Byzantine agreement primitive with an external validity condition. Apparently, no such efficient asynchronous atomic broadcast protocol maintaining liveness and safety in the Byzantine model has appeared previously in the literature. Secure causal broadcast extends atomic broadcast by encryption to guarantee a causal order among the delivered messages. Our protocols use threshold cryptography for signatures, encryption, and coin-tossing.},

	abstract = {The surging interest in blockchain technology has revitalized the search for effective Byzantine consensus schemes. In particular, the blockchain community has been looking for ways to effectively integrate traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols into a blockchain consensus layer allowing various financial institutions to securely agree on the order of transactions. However, existing BFT protocols can only scale to tens of nodes due to their O(n 2) message complexity. In this paper, we propose FastBFT, a fast and scalable BFT protocol. At the heart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight secret sharing. Combining this technique with several other optimizations (i.e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure detection), FastBFT achieves low latency and high throughput even for large scale networks. Via systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that FastBFT has better scalability and performance than previous BFT protocols.},

	abstract = {State-machine replication, a fundamental approach to designing fault-tolerant services, requires commands to be executed in the same order by all replicas. Moreover, command execution must be deterministic: each replica must produce the same output upon executing the same sequence of commands. These requirements usually result in single-threaded replicas, which hinders service performance. This paper introduces Parallel State-Machine Replication (P-SMR), a new approach to parallelism in state-machine replication. P-SMR scales better than previous proposals since no component plays a centralizing role in the execution of independent commands-those that can be executed concurrently, as defined by the service. The paper introduces P-SMR, describes a "commodified architecture" to implement it, and compares its performance to other proposals using a key-value store and a networked file system.},

While the blockchain supports transactional provenance, the data management community and other scientific and industrial communities are assessing how blockchain can be used to enable certain key capabilities for business applications. We have reviewed a number of proof of concepts and early adoptions of blockchain solutions that we have been involved spanning diverse use cases to draw common data life cycle, persis- tence as well as analytics patterns used in real-world applications with the ultimate aim to identify new frontier of exciting re- search in blockchain data management and analytics.

As an example, after a single year of operation, RepuCoin can tolerate attacks compromising 51\% of the network{\textquoteright}s computing resources, even if such power stays maliciously seized for almost a whole year.

	abstract = {Byzantine Fault Tolerant state machine replication (BFT) protocols are replication protocols that tolerate arbitrary faults of a fraction of the replicas. Although significant efforts have been recently made, existing BFT protocols do not provide acceptable performance when faults occur. As we show in this paper, this comes from the fact that all existing BFT protocols targeting high throughput use a special replica, called the primary, which indicates to other replicas the order in which requests should be processed. This primary can be smartly malicious and degrade the performance of the system without being detected by correct replicas. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called RBFT for Redundant-BFT: we execute multiple instances of the same BFT protocol, each with a primary replica executing on a different machine. All the instances order the requests, but only the requests ordered by one of the instances, called the master instance, are actually executed. The performance of the different instances is closely monitored, in order to check that the master instance provides adequate performance. If that is not the case, the primary replica of the master instance is considered malicious and replaced. We implemented RBFT and compared its performance to that of other existing robust protocols. Our evaluation shows that RBFT achieves similar performance as the most robust protocols when there is no failure and that, under faults, its maximum performance degradation is about 3\%, whereas it is at least equal to 78\% for existing protocols.},

	abstract = {Conceptually, tuple spaces are shared memory objects that provide operations to store and retrieve ordered sets of data, called tuples. Tuples stored in a tuple space are accessed by the contents of their fields, working as an associative memory. Although there are some proposals for secure tuple spaces, accessing tuples through field contents makes these systems susceptible to attacks that could impair user and data privacy, since servers must access tuple data. In order to deal with these limitations and provide privacy in the tuple space model, this paper proposes some extensions to DepSpace, a tuple space system that implements dependability and security properties through a set of mechanisms that are not enough to ensure privacy. The resulting system provides privacy and, at the same time, allows tuple selection/matches similar to the traditional insecure model, i.e., it does not constraint the matching possibilities. The main problem to be addressed is that servers must select tuples based on their contents without knowing them. The proposed solution uses robust cryptographic schemes, as order-preserving encryption and homomorphic encryption, to provide this functionality without revealing the tuple contents. An analysis concerning security aspects of DepSpace is presented, as well as the benefits of the proposed solutions. A set of experiments, executed with an implementation of the proposed protocols, shows the feasibility of the proposed solutions and shed some light on both the behavior of the system and the costs to provide privacy in the tuple spaces model.},

	abstract = {Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus exhibits higher throughput in
comparison to Proof of Work (PoW) in blockchains. But BFT-based protocols
suffer from scalability problems with respect to the number of replicas in the
network. The main reason for this limitation is the quadratic message
complexity of BFT protocols. Previously, proposed solutions improve BFT
performance for normal operation, but will fall back to quadratic message
complexity once the protocol observes a certain number of failures. This makes
the protocol performance unpredictable as it is not guaranteed that the network
will face a a certain number of failures.
  As a result, such protocols are only scalable when conditions are favorable
(i.e., the number of failures are less than a given threshold). To address this
issue we propose Proteus, a new BFT-based consensus protocol which elects a
subset of nodes \$c\$ as a root committee. Proteus guarantees stable performance,
regardless of the number of failures in the network and it improves on the
quadratic message complexity of typical BFT-based protocols to \$O(cn)\$, where
\$c{\textless}{\textless}n\$, for large \$n\$.
  Thus, message complexity remains small and less than quadratic when \$c\$ is
asymptotically smaller than \$n\$, and this helps the protocol to provide stable
performance even during the view change process (change of root committee). Our
view change process is different than typical BFT protocols as it replaces the
whole root committee compared to replacing a single primary in other protocols.
We deployed and tested our protocol on \$200\$ Amazon \$EC2\$ instances, with two
different baseline BFT protocols (PBFT and Bchain) for comparison. In these
tests, our protocol outperformed the baselines by more than \$2{\textbackslash}times\$ in terms
of throughput as well as latency.},

	abstract = {The old mantra of decentralizing the Internet is coming again with fanfare, this time around the blockchain technology hype. We have already seen a technology supposed to change the nature of the Internet: peer-to-peer. The reality is that peer-to-peer naming systems failed, peer-to-peer social networks failed, and yes, peer-to-peer storage failed as well. In this paper, we will review the research on distributed systems in the last few years to identify the limits of open peer-to-peer networks. We will address issues like system complexity, security and frailty, instability and performance. We will show how many of the aforementioned problems also apply to the recent breed of permissionless blockchain networks. The applicability of such systems to mature industrial applications is undermined by the same properties that make them so interesting for a libertarian audience: namely, their openness, their pseudo-anonymity and their unregulated cryptocurrencies. As such, we argue that permissionless blockchain networks are unsuitable to be the substrate for a decentralized Internet. Yet, there is still hope for more decentralization, albeit in a form somewhat limited with respect to the libertarian view of decentralized Internet: in cooperation rather than in competition with the superpowerful datacenters that dominate the world today. This is derived from the recent surge in interest in byzantine fault tolerance and permissioned blockchains, which opens the door to a world where use of trusted third parties is not the only way to arbitrate an ensemble of entities. The ability of establish trust through permissioned blockchains enables to move the control from the datacenters to the edge, truly realizing the promises of edge-centric computing.},

We then introduce parallel-chains, a simple yet powerful non-black-box composition technique for blockchain protocols. We showcase our technique by providing two parallel-chains protocol variants, one for the PoS and one for PoW setting, that exhibit optimal throughput under adaptive fail-stop corruptions while they retain their resiliency in the face of Byzantine adversity assuming honest majority of stake or computational power, respectively. We also apply our parallel-chains composition method to improve settlement latency; combining parallel composition with a novel transaction weighing mechanism we show that it is possible to scale down the time required for a transaction to settle by any given constant while maintaining the same level of security.},

	abstract = {Consensus is a fundamental problem of distributed computing. While this problem has been known to be unsolvable since 1985, existing protocols were designed these past three decades to solve consensus under various assumptions. Today, with the recent advent of blockchains, new consensus implementations were proposed to make replicas reach an agreement on the order of transactions updating what is often referred to as a distributed ledger. Very little work has however been devoted to explore its theoretical ramifications. As a result, it is often unclear whether the same systems could be adapted to work in different environments. In this position paper, we explore the use of the Ethereum blockchain protocol in the context of a private chain where the set of participants is controlled. We argue that foundations are needed in order to precisely capture the guarantees of the consensus protocols of novel blockchain systems before one can deploy them safely. To this end, we define the termination of consensus to characterize when blockchain transactions commit and describe the existence of the Blockchain Anomaly in existing proof-of-work private chains.},

	abstract = {Service replication distributes an application over many processes for tolerating faults, attacks, and misbehavior among a subset of the processes. The established state-machine replication paradigm inherently requires the application to be deterministic. This paper distinguishes three models for dealing with non-determinism in replicated services, where some processes are subject to faults and arbitrary behavior (so-called Byzantine faults): first, a modular approach that does not require any changes to the potentially non-deterministic application (and neither access to its internal data); second, a master-slave approach, in which ties are broken by a leader and the other processes validate the choices of the leader; and finally, a treatment of applications that use cryptography and secret keys. Cryptographic operations and secrets must be treated specially because they require strong randomness to satisfy their goals. The paper also introduces two new protocols. The first uses the modular approach for filtering out non-de\${\textbackslash}backslash\$-ter\${\textbackslash}backslash\$-min\${\textbackslash}backslash\$-istic operations in an application. It ensures that all correct processes produce the same outputs and that their internal states do not diverge. The second protocol implements cryptographically secure randomness generation with a verifiable random function and is appropriate for certain security models. All protocols are described in a generic way and do not assume a particular implementation of the underlying consensus primitive.},

However, these techniques jeopardize advantages of the cloud such as elasticity of processing resources. In contrast, we propose decentralized private clouds to allow users to protect their privacy and still benefit from the advantages of cloud computing. Our approach utilizes idle resources of friends and family to realize a trusted, decentralized system in which cloud services can be operated securely and privacy-preserving.

Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed.
We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.
Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by pools that command less than {\textbackslash}(1/4{\textbackslash}) of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed {\textbackslash}(1/2{\textbackslash}) bound, but better than the current reality where a group of any size can compromise the system.},

Such a process p is a correct process that eventually has (a) timely input channels from t correct processes and (b) timely output channels to t correct processes (these input and output channels can connect p to different subsets of processes). As this synchrony condition was shown to be necessary and sufficient in the stronger asynchronous system model (a) enriched with message authentication, and (b) where the channels are bidirectional and have the same timing properties in both directions, it follows that it is also necessary and sufficient in the weaker system model considered in the paper. In addition to the fact that it closes a long-lasting problem related to Byzantine agreement, a noteworthy feature of the proposed algorithm lies in its design simplicity, which is a first-class property.},

What once was rightfully ours and under our control is now spread among uncountable entities across many locations. We have built a platform that securely distributes encrypted user-sensitive data. It uses the Bitcoin blockchain to keep a trust-less audit trail for data interactions and to manage access to user data. Our platform offers advantages to both users and service providers. The user enjoys the heightened transparency, control, and security of their personal data, while the service provider becomes much less vulnerable to single point-of failures and breaches, which in turn decreases their exposure to information-security liability, thereby saving them money and protecting their brand. Our work extends an idea developed by the author and two collaborators, a peer-to- peer network that uses blockchain technology and off-blockchain storage to securely distribute sensitive data in a decentralized manner using a custom blockchain protocol. Our two main contributions are: 1. developing this platform and 2. analyzing its feasibility in real-world applications. This includes designing a protocol for data authentication that runs on an Internet scale peer-to-peer network, abstracting complex interactions with encrypted data, building a dashboard for data auditing and management, as well as building servers and sample services that use this platform for testing and evaluation.

	abstract = {Interactive consistency is the problem in which n nodes, where up to t may be byzantine, each with its own private value, run an algorithm that allows all non-faulty nodes to infer the values of each other node. This problem is relevant to critical applications that rely on the combination of the opinions of multiple peers to provide a service. Examples include monitoring a content source to prevent equivocation or to track variability in the content provided, and resolving divergent state amongst the nodes of a distributed system. Previous works assume a fully synchronous system, where one can make strong assumptions such as negligible message delivery delays and/or detection of absent messages. However, practical, real-world systems are mostly asynchronous, i.e., they exhibit only some periods of synchrony during which message delivery is timely, thus requiring a different approach. In this paper, we present a thorough study on practical interactive consistency. We leverage the vast prior work on broadcast and byzantine consensus algorithms to design, implement and evaluate a set of algorithms, with varying timing assumptions and message complexity, that can be used to achieve interactive consistency in real-world distributed systems. We provide a complete, open-source implementation of each proposed interactive consistency algorithm by building a multi-layered stack of protocols that include several broadcast protocols, as well as a binary and a multi-valued consensus protocol. Most of these protocols have never been implemented and evaluated in a real system before. We analyze the performance of our suite of algorithms experimentally by engaging in both single instance and multiple parallel instances of each alternative.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05831},
	abstract = {Despite years of intensive research, Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) systems have not yet been adopted in practice. This is due to additional cost of BFT in terms of resources, protocol complexity and performance, compared with crash fault-tolerance (CFT). This overhead of BFT comes from the assumption of a powerful adversary that can fully control not only the Byzantine faulty machines, but at the same time also the message delivery schedule across the entire network, effectively inducing communication asynchrony and partitioning otherwise correct machines at will. To many practitioners, however, such strong attacks appear irrelevant. In this paper, we introduce cross fault tolerance or XFT, a novel approach to building reliable and secure distributed systems and apply it to the classical state-machine replication (SMR) problem. In short, an XFT SMR protocol provides the reliability guarantees of widely used asynchronous CFT SMR protocols such as Paxos and Raft, but also tolerates Byzantine faults in combination with network asynchrony, as long as a majority of replicas are correct and communicate synchronously. This allows the development of XFT systems at the price of CFT (already paid for in practice), yet with strictly stronger resilience than CFT {\textemdash} sometimes even stronger than BFT itself. As a showcase for XFT, we present XPaxos, the first XFT SMR protocol, and deploy it in a geo-replicated setting. Although it offers much stronger resilience than CFT SMR at no extra resource cost, the performance of XPaxos matches that of the state-of-the-art CFT protocols.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technologies have generated excitement, yet their potential to enable new forms of governance remains largely unexplored. Two confronting standpoints dominate the emergent debate around blockchain-based governance: discourses characterised by the presence of techno-determinist and market-driven values, which tend to ignore the complexity of social organisation; and critical accounts of such discourses which, whilst contributing to identifying limitations, consider the role of traditional centralised institutions as inherently necessary to enable democratic forms of governance. Therefore the question arises, can we build perspectives of blockchain-based governance that go beyond markets and states? In this article we draw on the Nobel laureate economist Elinor Ostrom's principles for self-governance of communities to explore the transformative potential of blockchain. We approach blockchain through the identification and conceptualisation of affordances that this technology may provide to communities. For each affordance, we carry out a detailed analysis situating each in the context of Ostrom's principles, considering both the potentials of algorithmic governance and the importance of incorporating communities' social practices. The relationships found between these affordances and Ostrom's principles allow us to provide a perspective focussed on blockchain-based commons governance. By carrying out this analysis, we aim to expand the debate from one dominated by a culture of competition to one that promotes a culture of cooperation.},

We start with a conceptual model for implementing measuring instruments in a distributed blockchain-based architecture and compare it with traditional measuring instruments and distributed measuring models discussed in previous works. We also made a security analysis, demonstrating that blockchain-based measuring systems can impact the way measuring instruments are used in consumer relations while improving security and simplifying metrological regulation and control. We implement a vehicle speed measuring system using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. We evaluate the security and performance of our blockchain-based measuring system by executing tests with data from real speed meter sensors. The results are promising and validate the feasibility of our idea.

In this paper, we first survey the state of the art, focusing on private blockchains (in which parties are authenticated). We analyze both in-production and research systems in four dimensions: distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus protocol and smart contract. We then present BLOCKBENCH, a benchmarking framework for understanding performance of private blockchains against data processing workloads. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three major blockchain systems based on BLOCKBENCH, namely Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate several trade-offs in the design space, as well as big performance gaps between blockchain and database systems.

	abstract = {Consensus, or state machine replication is a foundational building block of distributed systems and modern cryptography. Consensus in the classical, permissioned setting has been extensively studied in the 30 years of distributed systems literature. Recent developments in Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies popularized a new form of consensus in a {\textquotedblleft}permissionless{\textquotedblright} setting, where anyone can join and leave dynamically, and there is no a-priori knowledge of the consensus nodes. Despite this exciting breakthrough, today{\textquoteright}s permissionless consensus protocols, often referred to as {\textquotedblleft}blockchains{\textquotedblright}, are known to have terrible performance, which has resulted in heated, and at times acrimonious debates in the community. First, we show that unfortunately a performance loss is inherent for any protocol that secures against at least 1/3 corruptions in hashpower. Specifically, we formally define a new performance measure called responsiveness, and show that any responsive permissionless consensus protocol cannot tolerate 1/3 or more corruptions in hashpower. Next, we show a tightly matching uppper bound. Specifically, we propose a new permissionless consensus protocol called hybrid consensus, that is responsive and secures against up to 1/3 corruptions in hashpower. Hybrid consensus's idea is to bootstrap fast permissionless consensus by combining an inefficient blockchain protocol with a fast permissioned consensus protocol. Hybrid consensus uses the blockchain not to agree on transactions, but to agree on rotating committees which in turn execute permissioned consensus protocols to agree on transactions. While the high-level idea is intuitive, formally instantiating and reasoning about the protocol exposed a multitude of non-trivial technical subtleties and challenges.},

The recognition of this fact has fostered the interest in alternative approaches to security such as intrusion tolerance, which applies fault tolerance concepts and techniques to security problems. Albeit this area is quite promising, intrusion-tolerant distributed systems typically rely on the assumption that the system components fail or are compromised independently. This is a strong assumption that has been repeatedly questioned. In this paper we discuss how this assumption can be implemented in practice using diversity of system components. We present a taxonomy of axes of diversity and discuss how they provide failure independence. Furthermore, we provide a practical example of an intrusion-tolerant system built using diversity.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Byzantine consensus algorithms have seen a surge in popularitywith the rise of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. A major problem that hampersadoption of existing consensus algorithms in blockchain scenarios is their scalability. There has been much research in the past years aiming to optimize thesealgorithms and increase their efficiency. For example, recent work has shown that voting rounds present in many classical algorithms can be made drastically more efficient by the use of message aggregation techniques. 
 
Another trend is towards the usage of trusted hardware to increase performance and lower resource requirementsof these algorithms. Trusted hardware enables algorithms to reduce the lower bound on the number of replicas from \$3f+1\$ to \$2f+1\$, where \$f\$ is the number of tolerated faults. Currently, all existing Byzantine consensus algorithms either use no trusted hardware at all, or assume that all replicas have access to the same trusted hardware. This leaves a gap in the design space, neglecting scenarios where only some machines have access to trusted hardware.  
 
In this work, we investigate the possibilities where only a subset of all replicas has access to trusted hardware. We introduce the SACBFT framework, consisting of two transformations that can be applied to existing Byzantine consensus protocols, increasing their efficiency by allowing them to make use of trusted hardware that exists in the system. 
 
We apply the framework to PBFT and RePBFT to produce SACPBFT and SACRePBFT respectively, and show how to apply the framework to other protocols. We also evaluate a proof-of-concept implementation of SACPBFT, showing that it can dramatically reduce network usage and increase performance even when only a single replica has access to trusted hardware.},

	abstract = {Consensus is a fundamental problem of distributed computing. While this problem has been known to be unsolvable since 1985, existing protocols were designed these past three decades to solve consensus under various assumptions. Today, with the recent advent of blockchains, various consensus implementations were proposed to make replicas reach an agreement on the order of transactions updating what is often referred to as a distributed ledger. Very little work has however been devoted to explore its theoretical ramifications. As a result existing proposals are sometimes misunderstood and it is often unclear whether the problems arising during their executions are due to implementation bugs or more fundamental design issues.In this paper, we discuss the mainstream blockchain consensus algorithms and how the classic Byzantine consensus can be revisited for the blockchain context. In particular, we discuss proof-of-work consensus and illustrate the differences between the Bitcoin and the Ethereum proof-of-work consensus algorithms. Based on these definitions, we warn about the dangers of using these blockchains without understanding precisely the guarantees their consensus algorithm offers. In particular, we survey attacks against the Bitcoin and the Ethereum consensus algorithms. We finally discuss the advantage of the recent Blockchain Byzantine consensus definition over previous definitions, and the promises offered by emerging consistent blockchains.},

	abstract = {Despite the hype about blockchains and distributed ledgers, no formal abstraction of these objects has been proposed. To face this issue, in this paper we provide a proper formulation of a distributed ledger object. In brief, we define a ledger object as a sequence of records, and we provide the operations and the properties that such an object should support. Implementation of a ledger object on top of multiple (possibly geographically dispersed) computing devices gives rise to the distributed ledger object. In contrast to the centralized object, distribution allows operations to be applied concurrently on the ledger, introducing challenges on the consistency of the ledger in each participant. We provide the definitions of three well known consistency guarantees in terms of the operations supported by the ledger object: (1) atomic consistency (linearizability), (2) sequential consistency, and (3) eventual consistency. We then provide implementations of distributed ledgers on asynchronous message passing crash-prone systems using an Atomic Broadcast service, and show that they provide eventual, sequential or atomic consistency semantics. We conclude with a variation of the ledger - the validated ledger - which requires that each record in the ledger satisfies a particular validation rule.},

In more detail, we produce two new randomized algorithms that solve this problem in the abstract MAC layer model, which captures the basic interface and communication guarantees provided by most wireless MAC layers. Our algorithms work for any number of failures, require no advance knowledge of the network participants or network size, and guarantee termination with high probability after a number of broadcasts that are polynomial in the network size. Our first algorithm satisfies the standard agreement property, while our second trades a faster termination guarantee in exchange for a looser agreement property in which most nodes agree on the same value. These are the first known fault-tolerant consensus algorithms for this model. In addition to our main upper bound results, we explore the gap between the abstract MAC layer and the standard asynchronous message passing model by proving fault-tolerant consensus is impossible in the latter in the absence of information regarding the network participants, even if we assume no faults, allow randomized solutions, and provide the algorithm a constant-factor approximation of the network size.},

	abstract = {Safety-critical real-time systems, including real-time cyber-physical and industrial control systems, need not be solely correct but also timely. Untimely (stale) results may have severe consequences that could render the control system{\textquoteright}s behaviour hazardous to the physical world. To ensure predictability and timeliness, developers follow a rigorous process, which essentially ensures real-time properties a priori, in all but the most unlikely combinations of circumstances. However, we have seen the complexity of both real-time applications, and the environments they run on, increase. If this is matched with the also increasing sophistication of attacks mounted to RTES systems, the case for ensuring both safety and security through aprioristic predictability loses traction, and presents an opportunity, which we take in this paper, for discussing current practices of critical realtime system design. To this end, with a slant on low-level task scheduling, we first investigate the challenges and opportunities for anticipating successful attacks on real-time systems. Then, we propose ways for adapting traditional fault- and intrusiontolerant mechanisms to tolerate such hazards. We found that tasks which typically execute as analyzed under accidental faults, may exhibit fundamentally different behavior when compromised by malicious attacks, even with interference enforcement in place.},

To achieve scalability across servers in more than 10 countries located on 4 different continents, we drastically revisited Byzantine fault tolerant blockchains and verification of signatures. The resulting blockchain, called the Red Belly Blockchain (RBBC), commits more than a hundred thousand transactions issued by permissionless nodes. These transactions are grouped into blocks within few seconds through a partially synchronous consensus run by permissioned nodes. It prevents double spending by guaranteeing that a unique block is decided at any given index of the chain in a deterministic way by all participants. We compared the performance of RBBC against traditional Byzantine fault tolerant alternatives and more recent randomized solutions. In the same geo-distributed environment with low-end machines, we noticed two interesting comparisons: (i) the RBBC throughput scales to hundreds of machines whereas the classic 3-step leader-based BFT state machine used by consortium blockchains cannot scale to 40 identically configured nodes; (ii) RBBC guarantees transaction finality in 3 seconds and experiences a third of the latency that randomized-based solutions like HoneyBadgerBFT can offer. This empirical evaluation demonstrates that blockchain scalability can be achieved without sacrificing security.},

These protocols use a new abstraction called view generators, that captures the agreement requirements of reconfiguration and can be implemented in different system models with different properties. Particularly interesting, we present a reconfiguration protocol that is modular, efficient, consensus-free and loosely coupled with read/write protocols. An analysis and an experimental evaluation show that the proposed protocols improve the overall system performance when compared with previous solutions.},

Based on partitioned service state, parallelism is introduced to both agreement and execution to address performance and scalability limitations caused by the global total order of all requests. However, in case of inefficient state partitioning, expensive synchronization among partitions is expected, which leads to a considerable performance loss. To improve the efficiency of parallel processing, we present Dynamic State Partitioning (DYPART), a framework that maps service state into multiple partitions and periodically reconfigures the partitions for different usage patterns. DYPART relies on the knowledge about relations between the state objects for partitioning, which is obtained by collecting request dependencies. It utilizes a highperformance graph partitioning algorithm to ensure that the resulting state partitions can achieve both workload balance and low synchronization among partitions. Our evaluation of a key-value store shows that compared to a random partitioning, DYPART can improve the performance by at least 40\%.},

Today a variety of solution to this problem exist, each optimized for particular execution conditions. Given that, in most cases, real systems operate under dynamic conditions, it is important to develop mechanisms that allow the algorithms to be adapted or changed at runtime to optimize the system to the current conditions. The problem of dynamic adaptation of consensus algorithms is not new, but the literature is scarce for the Byzantine case and there is no comprehensive comparison of existing solutions. This work has two complementary objectives. First, it studies how the different dynamic adaptation techniques proposed for the crash failure model can be applied in the presence of Byzantine faults. Second, it presents a comparative study of the performance of these switching algorithms in practice. For that purpose, we have implemented the switching algorithms in a common software framework, based on the open source BFT-SMaRt library. Using this framework we have performed an extensive evaluation that offers useful insights on the practical effects of different mechanisms used to support the run-time switching among Byzantine protocols.

	abstract = {We do a game-theoretic analysis of leader election, under the assumption that each agent prefers to have some leader than to have no leader at all. We show that it is possible to obtain a fair Nash equilibrium, where each agent has an equal probability of being elected leader, in a completely connected network, in a bidirectional ring, and a unidirectional ring, in the synchronous setting. In the asynchronous setting, Nash equilibrium is not quite the right solution concept. Rather, we must consider ex post Nash equilibrium; this means that we have a Nash equilibrium no matter what a scheduling adversary does. We show that ex post Nash equilibrium is attainable in the asynchronous setting in all the networks we consider, using a protocol with bounded running time. However, in the asynchronous setting, we require that n {\textgreater} 2. We can get a fair -Nash equilibrium if n = 2 in the asynchronous setting, under some cryptographic assumptions (specifically, the existence of a pseudo-random number generator and polynomially-bounded agents), using ideas from bit-commitment protocols. We then generalize these results to a setting where we can have deviations by a coalition of size k. In this case, we can get what we call a fair k-resilient equilibrium if n {\textgreater} 2k; under the same cryptographic assumptions, we can a get a k-resilient equilibrium if n = 2k. Finally, we show that, under minimal assumptions, not only do our protocols give a Nash equilibrium, they also give a sequential equilibrium [Kreps and Wilson 1982], so players even play optimally off the equilibrium path.},

In certain system models, indeed, the two problems are computationally equivalent: any solution to the former problem leads to a solution to the latter, and vice versa. In this paper, we study the relation between consensus and SMR from a complexity perspective. We find that, surprisingly, completing an SMR command can be more expensive than solving a consensus instance. Specifically, given a synchronous system model where every instance of consensus always terminates in constant time, completing an SMR command does not necessarily terminate in constant time. This result naturally extends to partially synchronous models. Besides theoretical interest, our result also corresponds to practical phenomena we identify empirically. We experiment with two well-known SMR implementations (Multi-Paxos and Raft) and show that, indeed, SMR is more expensive than consensus in practice. One important implication of our result is that {\textendash} even under synchrony conditions {\textendash} no SMR algorithm can ensure bounded response times.},

Since blockchains are at an early stage, there is little product data or reliable technology evaluation available to compare different blockchains. In this paper, we propose how to classify and compare blockchains and blockchain-based systems to assist with the design and assessment of their impact on software architectures. Our taxonomy captures major architectural characteristics of blockchains and the impact of their principal design decisions.

The key contribution of the work of Blockchain is the consensus algorithm, which decides how agreement is made to append a new block between all nodes in the verifying network. Blockchain algorithms can be categorized into two main groups. The first group is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the verifying network to show that they are more qualified than the others to do the appending work. The second group is voting-based consensus, which requires nodes in the network to exchange their results of verifying a new block or transaction, before making the final decision. In this paper, we present a review of the Blockchain consensus algorithms that have been researched and that are being applied in some well-known applications at this time.},

	abstract = {Modern IoT deployments do require considerable investments that might only be justified if the data being gathered could be monetized, which leads to the need for a digital data marketplace. In many cases, the provider of the IoT data needs to process it locally for data curation, aggregation, stream processing, etc. At the same time, the consumer could be interested in nearby data. This scenario resembles a fog computing architecture where companies require being able, keeping data under their control, to securely make it available to other companies in a peer-to-peer fashion, without needing a cloud intermediary (like traditional marketplaces do), thus maximizing the locality of the processing and avoiding the existence of a bottleneck when the intermediary makes the data delivery for accounting purposes. Nevertheless, this imposes a hard requirement: by not having a central marketplace, the peers (seller and customer) need to trust each other, which, in turn, requires enforcing a nonrepudiation schema. In this paper, the authors propose a distributed peer-to-peer architecture for such a data marketplace that takes advantage of the architectural fundamentals of fog computing, in which data processing, filtering, and stream based event generation is done in a fog node along with the data, and where relationships, both commercial agreements and data delivery, are performed directly between producers and consumers without the need of mutual trust thanks to the usage of blockchain principles (e.g., distributed ledger, consensus mechanism). The proposed architecture is validated through a case study involving a set of key issues regarding nonrepudiation commonly identified when moving from a centralized marketplace to a distributed one. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed solution does not bring in any limitation with regard to a centralized marketplace solution, in terms of pricing models (subscriptions, pay-per-use, etc.) or usage conditions (contract duration, updates rate, etc.).},

Then, the paper presents a simple and modular Byzantine consensus algorithm that relies neither on a leader, nor on signatures, nor on randomization. It features the fastest multivalued reduction to binary consensus we know of and a time optimal binary Byzantine consensus algorithm. The multivalued reduction runs multiple instances of binary consensus concurrently, which result in a bitmask that is then applied to a vector of multivalued proposals to filter out a valid proposed value that is decided. To ensure eventual decision deterministically, the underlying binary consensus algorithm assumes eventual synchrony.},

	abstract = {This paper presents Mir-BFT (or, simply, Mir), a robust asynchronous
Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) total order broadcast protocol aimed at
maximizing throughput on wide-area networks (WANs) with up to 100 nodes. This
deployment setting is highly relevant to many permissioned and Proof-of-Stake
permissionless blockchains.
  Mir achieves unprecedented throughput on WANs without sacrificing latency,
robustness to malicious behavior, or even performance in clusters. To achieve
this, Mir is the first BFT protocol that allows a set of leaders to propose
request batches independently, in parallel, while preventing request
duplication performance attacks through a rotating assignment of a partitioned
request hash space to leaders. We also propose several optimizations to Mir
that boost the throughput even further, including partial replication through a
novel abstraction we call light total order (LTO) broadcast.
  Perhaps most importantly, Mir relies on proven BFT protocol constructs, which
is fundamental to Mir provability and correctness. Specifically, Mir is a
generalization of the celebrated and scrutinized PBFT protocol. While Mir
follows PBFT ``safety-wise'', it introduces substantial changes with respect to
PBFT liveness (i.e., leader election), which help it become the highest
throughput BFT protocol on WANs with up to 100 nodes to date, reaching more
than 23000 Bitcoin-sized tps.},

However, practically all of these solutions were designed and optimized only for certain, typically very limited set of environment conditions. Despite previous efforts, no existing BFT replication protocol can guarantee stable and reasonable performance in both correct and faulty environments. In this article we attempt to address this problem by introducing Supr, a novel method for effortlessly combining multiple replication protocols into adaptive BFT solutions, which accommodate to a much wider spectrum of environment conditions than the existing BFT systems. Unlike previous approaches, Supr uses a fine-grained mechanism to monitor the parameters of the execution environment, which enables detecting and counteracting arbitrary faults exhibited in the system. To demonstrate its potential, we use Supr to create a sample BFT solution combining three existing replication protocols, each optimized for different conditions. The performed experiments demonstrate that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing solutions in varying environment conditions, but also does not introduce an observable overhead in stable environments.},

	abstract = {Currently, in all blockchain protocols each node stores all states (account balances, contract code and storage, etc.) and processes all transactions. This provides a large amount of security, but greatly limits scalability: a blockchain cannot process more transactions than a single node can. In large part because of this, Bitcoin is limited to \~{}3-7 transactions per second, Ethereum to 7-15, etc. However, this poses a question: are there ways to create a new mechanism, where only small subset of nodes verifies each transaction? As long as there are su?ciently many nodes verifying each transaction that the system is still highly secure, but a su?ciently small percentage of the total validator set that the system can process many transactions in parallel, could we not use such a technique to greatly increase a blockchain's throughput?},

However, DLT is available in different designs that exhibit diverse characteristics. Moreover , DLT characteristics have complementary and conflicting interdependencies. Hence, there will never be an ideal DLT design for all DLT use cases; instead, DLT implementations need to be configured to contextual requirements. Successful DLT configuration requires, however, a sound understanding of DLT characteristics and their interdependencies. In this manuscript, we review DLT characteristics and organize them into six groups. Furthermore, we condense interdependencies of DLT characteristics into trade-offs that should be considered for successful deployment of DLT. Finally, we consolidate our findings into DLT archetypes for common design objectives , such as security, usability, or performance. Our work makes extant DLT research more transparent and fosters understanding of interdependencies and trade-offs between DLT characteristics.},

	abstract = {Companies have evolved from a world where they only had SQL databases to a world where they use different kinds of data stores, such as key-value data stores, document-oriented data stores and graph databases. The reason why they have started to introduce this diversity of persistency models is because different NoSQL technologies bring different data models with associated query languages and/or APIs. However, they are confronted now with a problem in which they have the data scattered across different data stores. This problem lies in that when a business action requires to update the data, the data reside in different data stores, and they are subject to inconsistencies in the event of failure and/or concurrent access. These inconsistencies appear due to the lack of transactional consistency that was guaranteed in traditional SQL databases but is not guaranteed either within the NoSQL data stores or across data stores and databases. CoherentPaaS comes to remedy this need. CoherentPaaS provides an ultra-scalable transactional management layer that can be integrated with any data store with multi- versioning capabilities. The layer has been integrated with six different data stores, three NoSQL data stores and three SQL-like databases. In this paper, we describe this generic ultra-scalable transactional management layer and focus on its API and how it can be integrated in different ways with different data stores and databases.},

Compared with bitcoin-derived consensus mechanisms, Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (BFT) algorithms are more applicable for consortium blockchain. However, these algorithms work lies in the foundation that 3f + 1 nodes are required to tolerate only f faults, which results in high network traffic and cost. The hybrid fault model with Trusted Components (TC) assistance is proposed to reduce the minimum to 2f + 1 and improve overall performance. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic principles of BFT algorithms based on the hybrid fault model. Then we analyze different TC abstractions and implementation scenarios, and express our own choices. The general framework for BFT algorithms design choices and the applications of this model in blockchain are also discussed. Therefore, this paper aims to provide guidance for reasonable design of efficient BFT algorithms and application of TC assistance mechanism.},

	abstract = {Bias-resistant public randomness is a critical component in many (distributed) protocols. Existing solutions do not scale to hundreds or thousands of participants, as is needed in many decentralized systems. We propose two large-scale distributed protocols, RandHound and RandHerd, which provide publicly-verifiable, unpredictable, and unbiasable randomness against Byzantine adversaries. RandHound relies on an untrusted client to divide a set of randomness servers into groups for scalability, and it depends on the pigeonhole principle to ensure output integrity, even for non-random, adversarial group choices. RandHerd implements an efficient, decentralized randomness beacon. RandHerd is structurally similar to a BFT protocol, but uses RandHound in a one-time setup to arrange participants into verifiably unbiased random secret-sharing groups, which then repeatedly produce random output at predefined intervals. Our prototype demonstrates that RandHound and RandHerd achieve good performance across hundreds of participants while retaining a low failure probability by properly selecting protocol parameters, such as a group size and secret-sharing threshold. For example, when sharding 512 nodes into groups of 32, our experiments show that RandHound can produce fresh random output after 240 seconds. RandHerd, after a setup phase of 260 seconds, is able to generate fresh random output in intervals of approximately 6 seconds. For this configuration, both protocols operate at a failure probability of at most 0.08\% against a Byzantine adversary.},

One key feature of our proactive-reactive recovery approach is that, despite recoveries, it guarantees the availability of the minimum amount of system replicas necessary to sustain system's correct operation. We design a proactive-reactive recovery service based on a hybrid distributed system model and show, as a case study, how this service can effectively be used to augment the resilience of an intrusion-tolerant firewall adequate for the protection of critical infrastructures.},

We propose a partitioning approach to network security analysis that supports in-depth, stateful intrusion detection on high-speed links. The approach is centered around a slicing mechanism that divides the overall network traffic into subsets of manageable size. The traffic partitioning is done so that a single slice contains all the evidence necessary to detect a specific attack, making sensorto-sensor interactions unnecessary. This paper describes the approach and presents a first experimental evaluation of its effectiveness.},

This is achieved by constructing quorums in a decentralised way: each participant independently chooses whom to trust, and quorums arise from these individual decisions. Unfortunately, the theoretical foundations underlying such blockchains have not been thoroughly investigated. To close this gap, in this paper we study decentralised quorum construction by means of federated Byzantine quorum systems, used by Stellar. We rigorously prove the correctness of basic broadcast abstractions over federated quorum systems and establish their relationship to the classical Byzantine quorum systems. In particular, we prove correctness in the realistic setting where Byzantine nodes may lie about their trust choices. We show that this setting leads to a novel variant of Byzantine quorum systems where different nodes may have different understanding of what constitutes a quorum.},

	abstract = {Given the increasing adoption of Bitcoin, the number of transactions and the block sizes within the system are only expected to increase. To sustain its correct operation in spite of its ever-increasing use, Bitcoin implements a number of necessary optimizations and scalability measures. These measures limit the amount of information broadcast in the system to the minimum necessary. In this paper, we show that current scalability measures adopted by Bitcoin come at odds with the security of the system. More specifically, we show that an adversary can exploit these measures in order to effectively delay the propagation of transactions and blocks to specific nodes{\textemdash}without causing a network partitioning in the system. We show that this allows the adversary to easily mount Denial-of-Service attacks, considerably increase its mining advantage in the network, and double-spend transactions in spite of the current countermeasures adopted by Bitcoin. Based on our results, we propose a number of countermeasures in order to enhance the security of Bitcoin without deteriorating its scalability.},

	abstract = {Advances in the social sciences have emerged through a variety of research methods: field-based research, laboratory and field experiments, and agent-based models. However, which research method and approach is best suited to a particular inquiry is frequently debated and discussed. Working Together examines how different methods have promoted various theoretical developments related to collective action and the commons, and demonstrates the importance of cross-fertilization involving multiple-method research across traditional boundaries. The authors look at why cross-fertilization is difficult to achieve and they show ways for overcoming these challenges through collaboration.
The authors provide numerous examples of collaborative, multiple-method research related to collective action and the commons. They examine the pros and cons of case studies, meta-analyses, large-N field research, experiments and modeling, and empirically grounded agent-based models, and they consider how these methods contribute to research on collective action for the management of natural resources. Using their findings, the authors outline a revised theory of collective action that includes three elements: individual decision making, microsituational conditions, and features of the broader social-ecological context.
Acknowledging the academic incentives that influence and constrain how research is conducted, Working Together reworks the theory of collective action and offers practical solutions for researchers and students across a spectrum of disciplines

	abstract = {BlockChain (BC) has attracted tremendous attention due to its immutable nature and the associated security and privacy benefits. BC has the potential to overcome security and privacy challenges of Internet of Things (IoT). However, BC is computationally expensive, has limited scalability and incurs significant bandwidth overheads and delays which are not suited to the IoT context. We propose a tiered Lightweight Scalable BC (LSB) that is optimized for IoT requirements. We explore LSB in a smart home setting as a representative example for broader IoT applications. Low resource devices in a smart home benefit from a centralized manager that establishes shared keys for communication and processes all incoming and outgoing requests. LSB achieves decentralization by forming an overlay network where high resource devices jointly manage a public BC that ensures end-to-end privacy and security. The overlay is organized as distinct clusters to reduce overheads and the cluster heads are responsible for managing the public BC. LSB incorporates several optimizations which include algorithms for lightweight consensus, distributed trust and throughput management. Qualitative arguments demonstrate that LSB is resilient to several security attacks. Extensive simulations show that LSB decreases packet overhead and delay and increases BC scalability compared to relevant baselines.},

While in a standard network the set of participants is static and known, in an unknown network, such set and number of participants are previously unknown. This work studies the problem of Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus with Unknown Participants, namely BFT-CUP. This new problem aims at solving consensus in unknown networks with the additional requirement that participants in the system may behave maliciously. It presents the necessary and sufficient knowledge connectivity conditions in order to solve BFT-CUP under minimal synchrony requirements. In this way, it proposes algorithms that are shown to be optimal in terms of synchrony and knowledge connectivity among participants in the system.},

	title = {Efficient {Byzantine} {Fault} {Tolerance} for {Scalable} {Storage} and {Services}},
	abstract = {Abstract : Distributed systems experience and should tolerate faults beyond simple component crashes as such systems grow in size and importance. Unfortunately, tolerating arbitrary faults, also known as Byzantine faults, poses several challenges to system designers, often limiting performance, requiring additional hardware, or both. This dissertation presents new protocols that provide substantially better performance than previously demonstrated. The Byzantine fault-tolerant erasure-coded block storage protocol proposed in this thesis provides 40\% higher write throughput than the best prior approach. The Byzantine fault-tolerant replicated state machine provides a factor of 2.2-2.9 times higher throughput than the best prior approach. Furthermore, the protocols presented in this dissertation require 25-33\% fewer responsive servers than the nearest competitors. To enable these results, this dissertation introduces several new techniques, including homomorphic fingerprinting, partial encoding, and Byzantine Locking, that provide unprecedented scalability, higher throughput, lower latency, and lower computational overhead. This dissertation also considers new methods for analyzing the correctness of distributed systems in the presence of faulty clients. Distributed services and storage systems built using these techniques can provide Byzantine fault tolerance in a more efficient, higher performance, and more scalable manner than previously thought possible.},

Third, in nice executions the two algorithms run in the minimum number of communication steps for non-speculative and speculative algorithms, respectively 4 and 3 steps. Besides the obvious benefits in terms of cost, resilience and management complexity {\textemdash} fewer replicas to tolerate a certain number of faults {\textemdash} our algorithms are simpler than previous ones, being closer to crash fault-tolerant replication algorithms. The performance evaluation shows that, even with the trusted component access overhead, they can have better throughput than Castro and Liskov{\textquoteright}s PBFT, and better latency in networks with non-negligible communication delays.},

However, as their agreement protocols rely on a single leader and make big efforts to establish a global total order on all requests before execution, the performance and scalability of such approaches is limited. To address this problem we present SAREK, a parallel ordering framework that partitions the service state to exploit parallelism during both agreement as well as execution. SAREK utilizes request dependency which is abstracted from application-specific knowledge for the service state partitioning. Instead of having one leader at a time for the entire system, it uses one leader per partition and only establishes an order on requests accessing the same partition. SAREK supports operations that span multiple partitions and provides a deterministic mechanism to atomically process them. To address use cases in which there is not enough applicationspecific knowledge to always determine a priori which partition(s) a request will operate on, SAREK provides mechanisms to even handle mis-predictions without requiring rollbacks. Our evaluation of a key-value store shows an increase in throughput performance by a factor of 2 at half the latency compared to a single-leader implementation.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a deterministic Byzantine consensus algorithm that relies on a new weak coordinator. As opposed to previous algorithms that cannot terminate in the presence of a faulty or slow coordinator, our algorithm can terminate even when its coordinator is faulty, hence the name weak coordinator. The key idea is to allow processes to complete asynchronous rounds as soon as they receive a threshold of messages, instead of having to wait for a message from a coordinator that may be slow. The resulting algorithm assumes partial synchrony, is resilience optimal, time optimal and does not need signatures. Our presentation is didactic: we first present a simple safe binary Byzantine consensus algorithm, modify it to ensure termination, and finally present an optimized reduction from multivalue consensus to binary consensus that may terminate in 4 message delays. To evaluate our algorithm, we deployed it on 100 machines distributed in 5 datacenters across different continents and compared its performance against the randomized solution from Mostefaoui, Moumem and Raynal [PODC14] that terminates in O(1) rounds in expectation. Our algorithm always outperforms the latter even in the presence of Byzantine behaviors. Our algorithm has a subsecond average latency in most of our geo-distributed experiments, even when attacked by a well-engineered coalition of Byzantine processes.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has the potential to radically alter the way enterprises conduct business as well as the way institutions process transactions. Businesses and governments often operate in isolation but with blockchain technology participants can engage in business transactions with customers, suppliers, regulators, potentially spanning across geographical boundaries. Blockchain technology, at its core, features an immutable distributed ledger, a decentralized network that is cryptographically secured. Blockchain architecture gives participants the ability to share a ledger, through peer to peer replication, which is updated every time a block of transaction(s) is agreed to be committed. The technology can reduce operational costs and friction, create transaction records that are immutable, and enable transparent ledgers where updates are nearly instantaneous. It may also dramatically change the way workflow and business procedures are designed inside an enterprise and open up new opportunities for innovation and growth. Blockchain technology can be viewed from a business, legal and technical perspective: {\textbullet} From a business perspective, blockchain is an exchange network that facilitates transfer of value, assets, or other entities between willing and mutually agreeing participants, ensuring privacy and control of data to stakeholders {\textbullet} From a legal perspective, blockchain ledger transactions are validated, indisputable transactions, which do not require intermediaries or trusted third-party legal entities. {\textbullet} From a technical perspective, blockchain is a replicated, distributed ledger of transactions with ledger entries referencing other data stores (for additional information related to ledger transactions). Cryptography is used to ensure that network participants see only the parts of the ledger that are relevant to them, and that transactions are secure, authenticated and verifiable, in the context of permissioned business blockchains. This document will introduce basic blockchain concepts that define a standard reference architecture that can be used in creating blockchain applications. Blockchain Fundamentals A blockchain is a shared ledger distributed across a business network. Business transactions are permanently recorded in append-only blocks to the ledger. All the consensually confirmed and validated transaction blocks are linked from the genesis block to the most current block with each block linked to its previous block using the cryptographic hash of the previous block -hence the name blockchain.},

It was introduced to model and analyze the effects of very severe hardware faults in aircraft control systems. Lately, the Byzantine failure model has been used in the area of network security where Byzantine-tolerance is equated with resilience against malicious attackers. We discuss two reasons why one should be careful in doing so. Firstly, Byzantine-tolerance is not concerned with secrecy and so special means have to be employed if secrecy is a desired system property. Secondly, in contrast to the domain of hardware faults, in a security setting it is difficult to compute the assumption coverage of the Byzantine failure model, i.e., the probability that the failure assumption holds in practice. For this latter point we develop a methodology which allows to estimate the reliability of a Byzantine-tolerant solution exposed to attackers of different strengths.},

	abstract = {The high replication cost of Byzantine fault-tolerance (BFT) methods has been a major barrier to their widespread adoption in commercial distributed applications. We present ZZ, a new approach that reduces the replication cost of BFT services from 2f + 1 to practically f + 1. The key insight in ZZ is to use f + 1 execution replicas in the normal case and to activate additional replicas only upon failures. In data centers where multiple applications share a physical server, ZZ reduces the aggregate number of execution replicas running in the data center, improving throughput and response times. ZZ relies on virtualization{\textemdash}a technology already employed in modern data centers{\textemdash}for fast replica activation upon failures, and enables newly activated replicas to immediately begin processing requests by fetching state on-demand. A prototype implementation of ZZ using the BASE library and Xen shows that, when compared to a system with 2f + 1 replicas, our approach yields lower response times and up to 33\% higher throughput in a prototype data center with four BFT web applications. We also show that ZZ can handle simultaneous failures and achieve sub-second recovery.},

	doi = {10.1109/DSN.2018.00019},
	abstract = {Various protocols and architectures have been proposed to make Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) increasingly practical. However, the deployment of such systems requires dedicated client-side functionality. This is necessary as clients have to connect to multiple replicas and perform majority voting over the received replies to outvote faulty responses. Deploying custom client-side code is cumbersome, and often not an option, especially in open heterogeneous systems and for well-established protocols (e.g., HTTP and IMAP) where diverse client-side implementations co-exist. We propose Troxy, a system which relocates the BFT-specific client-side functionality to the server side, thereby making BFT transparent to legacy clients. To achieve this, Troxy relies on a trusted subsystem built upon hardware protection enabled by Intel SGX. Additionally, Troxy reduces the replication cost of BFT for read-heavy workloads by offering an actively maintained cache that supports trustworthy read operations while preserving the consistency guarantees offered by the underlying BFT protocol. A prototype of Troxy has been built and evaluated, and results indicate that using Troxy (1) leads to at most 43\% performance loss with small ordered messages in a local network environment, while (2) improves throughput by 130\% with read-heavy workloads in a simulated wide-area network.},

In order to deal with this specific kind of threats, BFT protocols rely on request authentication to provide access control. Nevertheless, byzantine clients may benefit from the weakness of the underlying authentications mechanisms in order to tamper with the performance of replicated systems. We describe the main reliability issues that can be introduced by faulty clients in current BFT protocols, and we argue against the systematic usage of digital signatures.

We assume the existence of a component, capable of executing timely functions, which helps applications with varying degrees of synchrony to behave reliably despite the occurrence of timing failures. We call this component the Timely Computing Base, TCB. This paper describes the TCB architecture and model, and discusses the application programming interface for accessing the TCB services. The implementation of the TCB services uses fail-awareness techniques to increase the coverage of TCB properties.},

High development and maintenance costs have limited strong security to high-cost or high-margin devices. Our group has begun a research agenda to bring high-value security to low-cost devices. We are especially concerned with the tens of billions of devices powered by microcontrollers. This class of devices is particularly ill-prepared for the security challenges of internet connectivity. Insufficient investments in the security needs of these and other price-sensitive devices have left consumers and society critically exposed to device security and privacy failures. This paper makes two contributions to the field of device security. First, we identify seven properties we assert are required in all highly secure devices. Second, we describe our experiment working with a silicon partner to revise one of their microcontrollers to create a prototype, highly secure microcontroller. Our experimental results suggest that in the near future even the most price-sensitive devices should be redesigned to achieve the high levels of device security critical to society's safety. While our first experimental results are promising, more ongoing research remains and we seek to enlist the broader security community in a dialog on device security.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the consensus problem in asynchronous systems prone to process crashes, where additionally the processes are anonymous (they cannot be distinguished one from the other: they have no name and execute the same code). To circumvent the three computational adversaries (asynchrony, failures and anonymity) each process is provided with a failure detector ofa class denoted $\psi$, that gives it an upper bound on the number of processes that are currently alive (in a non-anonymous system, the classes $\psi$ and P -the class of perfect failure detectors- are equivalent). The paper first presents a simple $\psi$-based consensus algorithm where the processes decide in 2t + 1 asynchronous rounds (where t is an upper bound on the number of faulty processes). It then shows one of its main results, namely, 2t + 1 is a lower bound for consensus in the anonymous systems equipped with $\psi$. The second contribution addresses early-decision. The paper presents and proves correct an early-deciding algorithm where the processes decide in min(2f + 2, 2t + 1) asynchronous rounds (where f is the actual number of process failures). This leads to think that anonymity doubles the cost (wrt synchronous systems) and it is conjectured that min(2f + 2, 2t + 1) is the corresponding lower bound. The paper finally considers the k-set agreement problem in anonymous systems. It first shows that the previous $\psi$-based consensus algorithm solves the k-set agreement problem in Rt = 2? t k ? +1 asynchronous rounds. Then, considering a family offailure detector classes \{$\psi$?\}1<=?<=k that generalizes the class $\psi$(= $\psi$1), the paper presents an algorithm that solves the k-set agreement in Rt,? = 2? t k-?+1?+1 asynchronous rounds. This last formula relates the cost (Rt,?), the coordination degree of the problem (k), the maximum number of failures (t) and the the strength (?) of the underlying failure detector.

They are notoriously difficult to develop, test and prove. We present a new abstraction to simplify these tasks. We treat a BFT protocol as a composition of instances of our abstraction. Each instance is developed and analyzed independently. To illustrate our approach, we first show how our abstraction can be used to obtain the benefits of a state-of-the-art BFT protocol with much less pain. Namely, we develop AZyzzyva, a new protocol that mimics the behavior of Zyzzyva in best-case situations (for which Zyzzyva was optimized) using less than 24\% of the actual code of Zyzzyva. To cover worst-case situations, our abstraction enables to use in AZyzzyva any existing BFT protocol, typically, a classical one like PBFT which has been tested and proved correct. We then present Aliph, a new BFT protocol that outperforms previous BFT protocols both in terms of latency (by up to 30\%) and throughput (by up to 360\%). The development of Aliph required two new instances of our abstraction. Each instance contains less than 25\% of the code needed to develop state-of-the-art BFT protocols.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is a decentralised currency and payment system that seeks to eliminate the need for trusted authorities. It relies on a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic protocols to perform the functions of traditional financial intermediaries, such as verifying transactions and preserving the integrity of the system. This article examines the political economy of Bitcoin, in light of a recent dispute that divided the Bitcoin community with regard to a seemingly simple technical issue: whether or not to increase the block size of the Bitcoin blockchain. By looking at the socio-technical constructs of Bitcoin, the article distinguishes between two distinct coordination mechanisms: governance by the infrastructure (achieved via the Bitcoin protocol) and governance of the infrastructure (managed by the community of developers and other stakeholders). It then analyses the invisible politics inherent in these two mechanisms, which together display a highly technocratic power structure. On the one hand, as an attempt to be self-governing and self-sustaining, the Bitcoin network exhibits a strong market-driven approach to social trust and coordination, which has been embedded directly into the technical protocol. On the other hand, despite being an open source project, the development and maintenance of the Bitcoin code ultimately relies on a small core of highly skilled developers who play a key role in the design of the platform. Teaser: As a trustless technology, Bitcoin tries to solve issues of social coordination and economic exchange by relying, only and exclusively, on technological means. Yet, when looking deeper into the governance structure of this technology, it becomes apparent that technology alone is unable to resolve most of the social and political concerns affecting the Bitcoin network.},

We investigate the features of infrastructures that can be interpreted as common pool resources. Related to four essential functions (system management, capacity management, interconnection and interoperability) we typify common pool resource problems in infrastructures. Since infrastructures are evolving into ever lager, more complex and international systems, the governance of CPR problems seems to shift from vertically integrated firms under strict governmental control towards a distributed market oriented governance. The institutional and technological fragmentation of infrastructures on one hand, and the globalization of the infrastructure networks and business on the other hand, demand new approaches to govern these vital sectors.

	abstract = {We analyze geographic patterns of trade between individuals using transactions data from eBay and MercadoLibre, two large online auction sites. We find that distance continues to be an important deterrent to trade between geographically separated buyers and sell ers, though to a lesser extent than has been observed in studies of non-Internet commerce between business counterparties. We also find a strong uhome bias" for trading with counterparties located in the same city. Further analyses suggest that location-specific goods such as opera tickets, cultural factors, and the possibility of direct contract enforcement in case of breach may be the main reasons behind the same-city bias. (JEL D44, Fll, R12) An extensive literature in international economics analyzes the impact of dis tance on trade flows. Starting with Jan Tinbergen (1962), the stylized finding of a large number of papers estimating the "gravity equation" is that trade volume between two countries increases with the size of their economies and decreases with the distance that separates them. A subset of these papers also reports a significant "border effect." Controlling for distance, trade between two regions is lower if the goods have to cross national borders (John McCallum 1995, and James E. Anderson and Eric van Wincoop 2003). Moreover, when the home bias has been tested for US intranational trade flows, state limits seemed to have an effect on trade similar to that of national borders (Holger C. Wolf 2000, and Russell Hillberry and David L. Hummels 2003). Anderson and van Wincoop (2004), in their recent review of this literature, point out transportation costs and tariffs/taxes as the main frictions contributing to the decline of trade flow with distance and the border effect. They also discuss a growing num ber of papers on "informational frictions." Such informational frictions include search},

	abstract = {Decentralization, which has backed the hyper growth of many blockchains, comes at the cost of scalability. To understand this fundamental limitation, this paper proposes a quantitative measure of blockchain decentralization, and discusses its implications to various trust models and consensus algorithms. Further, we identify the major challenges in blockchain decentralization. Our key findings are that true decentralization is hard to achieve due to the skewed mining power and that a fully decentralized blockchain inherently limits scalability as it incurs a throughput upper bound and prevents scaling smart contract execution. To address these challenges, we outline three research directions to explore the trade-offs between decentralization and scalability.},

	abstract = {Critical infrastructures have evolved over the past decades to become largely computerised and interconnected all over the world. This generated the problem of achieving resilience of Critical Information Infrastructures (CII) against computer-borne attacks and severe faults, similar to those observed in the internet. Governments and industry have been pushing an immense research effort in information and systems security, but we believe the complexity of the problem prevents it from being solved using classical security methods. This paper focuses on the computer systems behind electrical utility infrastructures. It proposes the blueprint of a distributed systems architecture that we believe may come to be useful as a reference for modern CII in general. The architecture is instantiated with a set of classes of techniques and algorithms, based on paradigms providing resilience to faults and attacks in an automatic way.

Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one of more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement. It is shown that, using only oral messages, this problem is solvable if and only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal; so a single traitor can confound two loyal generals. With unforgeable written messages, the problem is solvable for any number of generals and possible traitors. Applications of the solutions to reliable computer systems are then discussed.},

	url = {http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/765},
	abstract = {Bitcoin is the first and most popular decentralized cryptocurrency to date. In this work, we extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol, which we term the Bitcoin backbone, and prove two of its fundamental properties which we call common prefix and chain quality in the static setting where the number of players remains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and novel assumptions on the hashing power of the adversary relative to network synchronicity; we show our results to be tight under high synchronization. Next, we propose and analyze applications that can be built on top of the backbone protocol, specifically focusing on Byzantine agreement (BA) and on the notion of a public transaction ledger. Regarding BA, we observe that Nakamoto's suggestion falls short of solving it, and present a simple alternative which works assuming that the adversary's hashing power is bounded by 1/3. The public transaction ledger captures the essence of Bitcoin's operation as a cryptocurrency, in the sense that it guarantees the liveness and persistence of committed transactions. Based on this notion we describe and analyze the Bitcoin system as well as a more elaborate BA protocol, proving them secure assuming high network synchronicity and that the adversary's hashing power is strictly less than 1/2, while the adversarial bound needed for security decreases as the network desynchronizes. Finally, we show that our analysis of the Bitcoin backbone protocol for synchronous networks extends with relative ease to the recently considered partially synchronous model, where there is an upper bound in the delay of messages that is unknown to the honest parties.},

The proof-of-work blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have been shown both theoretically and empirically vulnerable to double spending attacks. This is why Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms have gained popularity in the blockchain context for their ability to tolerate a limited number t of attackers among n participants. We formalize the recently proposed proof-of-authority consensus algorithms that are Byzantine fault tolerant by describing the Aura and Clique protocols present in the two mainstream implementations of Ethereum. We then introduce the Cloning Attack and show how to apply it to double spend in each of these protocols with a single malicious node. Our results show that the Cloning Attack against Aura is always successful while the same attack against Clique is about twice as fast and succeeds in most cases.},

	abstract = {Byzantine Fault Tolerant state machine replication (BFT) protocols are replication protocols that tolerate arbitrary faults of a fraction of the replicas. Although significant efforts have been recently made, existing BFT protocols do not provide acceptable performance when faults occur. As we show in this paper, this comes from the fact that all existing BFT protocols targeting high throughput use a special replica, called the primary, which indicates to other replicas the order in which requests should be processed. This primary can be smartly malicious and degrade the performance of the system without being detected by correct replicas. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called RBFT for Redundant-BFT: we execute multiple instances of the same BFT protocol, each with a primary replica executing on a different machine. All the instances order the requests, but only the requests ordered by one of the instances, called the master instance, are actually executed. The performance of the different instances is closely monitored, in order to check that the master instance provides adequate performance. If that is not the case, the primary replica of the master instance is considered malicious and replaced. We implemented RBFT and compared its performance to that of other existing robust protocols. Our evaluation shows that RBFT achieves similar performance as the most robust protocols when there is no failure and that, under faults, its maximum performance degradation is about 3\%, whereas it is at least equal to 78\% for existing protocols.},

We find that for both cryptocurrencies and programming languages, there is usually a handful of people that accounts for most of the discussion.

Mining the longest chain is a Markov perfect equilibrium, without forking, in line with Nakamoto (2008). The blockchain protocol, however, is a coordination game, with multiple equilibria. There exist equilibria with forks, leading to orphaned blocks and persistent divergence between chains. We also show how forks can be generated by information delays and software upgrades.

Considering an asynchronous message-passing system of n processes where (a) up to t {\textless} n/3 may commit Byzantine failures, and (b) each pair of processes is connected by two unidirectional channels (with possibly different timing properties), this paper investigates the synchrony assumption required to solve consensus, and presents a signature-free consensus algorithm whose synchrony requirement is the existence of a process that is an eventual t + 1 bisource. Such a process p is a correct process that eventually has (a) timely input channels from t correct processes and (b) timely output channels to t correct processes (these input and output channels can connect p to different subsets of processes). As this synchrony condition was shown to be necessary and sufficient in the stronger asynchronous system model (a) enriched with message authentication, and (b) where the channels are bidirectional and have the same timing properties in both directions, it follows that it is also necessary and sufficient in the weaker system model considered in the paper. In addition to the fact that it closes a long-lasting problem related to Byzantine agreement, a noteworthy feature of the proposed algorithm lies in its design simplicity, which is a first-class property.},

	abstract = {The problem of distributed consensus in the presence of Byzantine faults has received particular attention in recent decades. Today a variety of solution to this problem exist, each optimized for particular execution conditions. Given that, in most cases, real systems operate under dynamic conditions, it is important to develop mechanisms that allow the algorithms to be adapted or changed at runtime to optimize the system to the current conditions. The problem of dynamic adaptation of consensus algorithms is not new, but the literature is scarce for the Byzantine case and there is no comprehensive comparison of existing solutions. This work has two complementary objectives. First, it studies how the different dynamic adaptation techniques proposed for the crash failure model can be applied in the presence of Byzantine faults. Second, it presents a comparative study of the performance of these switching algorithms in practice. For that purpose, we have implemented the switching algorithms in a common software framework, based on the open source BFT-SMaRt library. Using this framework we have performed an extensive evaluation that offers useful insights on the practical effects of different mechanisms used to support the run-time switching among Byzantine protocols.},

	abstract = {Our growing reliance on online services accessible on the Internet demands highly available systems that provide correct service without interruptions. Software bugs, operator mistakes, and malicious attacks are a major cause of service interruptions and they can cause arbitrary behavior, that is, Byzantine faults. This article describes a new replication algorithm, BFT, that can be used to build highly available systems that tolerate Byzantine faults. BFT can be used in practice to implement real services: it performs well, it is safe in asynchronous environments such as the Internet, it incorporates mechanisms to defend against Byzantine-faulty clients, and it recovers replicas proactively. The recovery mechanism allows the algorithm to tolerate any number of faults over the lifetime of the system provided fewer than 1/3 of the replicas become faulty within a small window of vulnerability. BFT has been implemented as a generic program library with a simple interface. We used the library to implement the first Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS file system, BFS. The BFT library and BFS perform well because the library incorporates several important optimizations, the most important of which is the use of symmetric cryptography to authenticate messages. The performance results show that BFS performs 2\% faster to 24\% slower than production implementations of the NFS protocol that are not replicated. This supports our claim that the BFT library can be used to build practical systems that tolerate Byzantine faults.},

To understand this fundamental limitation, this paper proposes a quantitative measure of blockchain decentralization, and discusses its implications to various trust models and consensus algorithms. Further, we identify the major challenges in blockchain decentralization. Our key findings are that true decentralization is hard to achieve due to the skewed mining power and that a fully decentralized blockchain inherently limits scalability as it incurs a throughput upper bound and prevents scaling smart contract execution. To address these challenges, we outline three research directions to explore the trade-offs between decentralization and scalability.},

We introduce Astro, a system solving this problem efficiently in a decentralized, deterministic, and completely asynchronous manner. Astro builds on the insight that consensus is unnecessary to prevent double-spending. Instead of consensus, Astro relies on a weaker primitive---Byzantine reliable broadcast---enabling a simpler and more efficient implementation than consensus-based payment systems. In terms of efficiency, Astro executes a payment by merely broadcasting a message. The distinguishing feature of Astro is that it can maintain performance robustly, i.e., remain unaffected by a fraction of replicas being compromised or slowed down by an adversary. Our experiments on a public cloud network show that Astro can achieve near-linear scalability in a sharded setup, going from \$10K\$ payments/sec (2 shards) to \$20K\$ payments/sec (4 shards). In a nutshell, Astro can match VISA-level average payment throughput, and achieves a \$5{\textbackslash}times\$ improvement over a state-of-the-art consensus-based solution, while exhibiting sub-second \$95{\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$ percentile latency.},

The industry has so far addressed this problem by hardening crash-tolerant systems with ad hoc error detection checks, potentially overlooking critical fault scenarios. We propose a generic and principled hardening technique for Arbitrary State Corruption (ASC) faults, which specifically model the effects of realistic data corruptions on distributed processes. Hardening does not require the use of trusted components or the replication of the process over multiple physical servers. We implemented a wrapper library to transparently harden distributed processes. To exercise our library and evaluate our technique, we obtained ASC-tolerant versions of Paxos, of a subset of the ZooKeeper API, and of an eventually consistent storage by implementing crash-tolerant protocols and automatically hardening them using our library. Our evaluation shows that the throughput of our ASC-hardened state machine replication outperforms its Byzantine-tolerant counterpart by up to 70\%.},

However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains{\textquoteright} viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms.},

We study consensus algorithms that tolerate Byzantine failures and arbitrary long periods of asynchrony. We measure the ability of processes to reach a consensus decision in a minimal number of rounds of information exchange, as a function of (a) their ability to use authentication and (b) the number of actual process failures in those rounds, as well as of (c) the total number of failures tolerated and (d) the system constellation. The constellations considered distinguish different roles of processes, such that we can directly derive a meaningful bound on the time complexity of implementing robust general services using several replicas coordinated through consensus. To prove our theorem, we establish certain lower bounds and we give algorithms that match these bounds. The algorithms are all variants of the same generic asynchronous Byzantine consensus algorithm, which is interesting in its own right.},

Various companies are now moving towards Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchains with more conventional Byzantine fault tolerance, where a known set of n permissioned sealers among which no more than t are Byzantine seal blocks that include user transactions. Despite their wide adoption, these protocols were not proved correct. In this paper, we present the Cloning Attack against the two mostly deployed PoA implementations of Ethereum, namely Aura and Clique. The Cloning Attack consists in one sealer cloning its key-value pair into two distinct Ethereum instances that communicate with distinct groups of sealers. To identify their vulnerabilities, we first specified the corresponding algorithms. We then infer the topology of the largest PoA network, POA Core, through active measurement. We deploy one testnet for each protocol and demonstrate the success of the attack. Finally, we propose a simple counter-measure that prevents an adversary from double spending.},

We approach the problem of digital identity starting from a human rights perspective, with a primary focus on identity systems in the developed world. We assert that individual persons must be allowed to manage their personal information in a multitude of different ways in different contexts and that to do so, each individual must be able to create multiple unrelated identities. Therefore, we first define a set of fundamental constraints that digital identity systems must satisfy to preserve and promote privacy as required for individual autonomy. With these constraints in mind, we then propose a decentralised, standardsbased approach, using a combination of distributed ledger technology and thoughtful regulation, to facilitate many-to-many relationships among providers of key services. Our proposal for digital identity differs from others in its approach to trust in that we do not seek to bind credentials to each other or to a mutually trusted authority to achieve strong non-transferability. Because the system does not implicitly encourage its users to maintain a single aggregated identity that can potentially be constrained or reconstructed against their interests, individuals and organisations are free to embrace the system and share in its benefits.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07966},
	abstract = {Agreement protocols have been typically deployed at small scale, e.g., using three to five machines. This is because these protocols seem to suffer from a sharp performance decay. More specifically, as the size of a deployment---i.e., degree of replication---increases, the protocol performance greatly decreases. There is not much experimental evidence for this decay in practice, however, notably for larger system sizes, e.g., beyond a handful of machines. In this paper we execute agreement protocols on up to 100 machines and observe on their performance decay. We consider well-known agreement protocols part of mature systems, such as Apache ZooKeeper, etcd, and BFT-Smart, as well as a chain and a novel ring-based agreement protocol which we implement ourselves. We provide empirical evidence that current agreement protocols execute gracefully on 100 machines. We observe that throughput decay is initially sharp (consistent with previous observations); but intriguingly---as each system grows beyond a few tens of replicas---the decay dampens. For chain- and ring-based replication, this decay is slower than for the other systems. The positive takeaway from our evaluation is that mature agreement protocol implementations can sustain out-of-the-box 300 to 500 requests per second when executing on 100 replicas on a wide-area public cloud platform. Chain- and ring-based replication can reach between 4K and 11K (up to 20x improvements) depending on the fault assumptions.},

	abstract = {Byzantine reliable broadcast is a powerful primitive that allows a set of processes to agree on a message from a designated sender, even if some processes (including the sender) are Byzantine. Existing broadcast protocols for this setting scale poorly, as they typically build on quorum systems with strong intersection guarantees, which results in linear per-process communication and computation complexity. We generalize the Byzantine reliable broadcast abstraction to the probabilistic setting, allowing each of its properties to be violated with a fixed, arbitrarily small probability. We leverage these relaxed guarantees in a protocol where we replace quorums with stochastic samples. Compared to quorums, samples are significantly smaller in size, leading to a more scalable design. We obtain the first Byzantine reliable broadcast protocol with logarithmic per-process communication and computation complexity. We conduct a complete and thorough analysis of our protocol, deriving bounds on the probability of each of its properties being compromised. During our analysis, we introduce a novel general technique we call adversary decorators. Adversary decorators allow us to make claims about the optimal strategy of the Byzantine adversary without having to make any additional assumptions. We also introduce Threshold Contagion, a model of message propagation through a system with Byzantine processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal analysis of a probabilistic broadcast protocol in the Byzantine fault model. We show numerically that practically negligible failure probabilities can be achieved with realistic security parameters.},

Our false friends attack exploits the Kademlia-inspired peer discovery logic used by Geth and enables a low-resource eclipsing of longrunning, remote victim nodes. An adversary only needs two hosts in distinct /24 subnets to launch the eclipse, which can then be leveraged to filter the victim{\textquoteright}s view of the Blockchain.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04134},
	abstract = {Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus exhibits higher throughput in comparison to Proof of Work (PoW) in blockchains, but BFT-based protocols suffer from scalability problems with respect to the number of replicas in the network. The main reason for this limitation is the quadratic message complexity of BFT protocols. Previously, proposed solutions improve BFT performance for normal operation, but will fall back to quadratic message complexity once the protocol observes a certain number of failures. This makes the protocol performance unpredictable as it is not guaranteed that the network will face a a certain number of failures. As a result, such protocols are only scalable when conditions are favorable (i.e., the number of failures are less than a given threshold). To address this issue we propose Proteus, a new BFT-based consensus protocol which elects a subset of nodes c as a root committee. Proteus guarantees stable performance, regardless of the number of failures in the network and it improves on the quadratic message complexity of typical BFT-based protocols to O(cn), where c {\textless}{\textless} n, for large n. Thus, message complexity remains small and less than quadratic when c is asymptotically smaller than n, and this helps the protocol to provide stable performance even during the view change process (change of root committee). Our view change process is different than typical BFT protocols as it replaces the whole root committee compared to replacing a single primary in other protocols. We deployed and tested our protocol on 200 Amazon EC2 instances, with two different baseline BFT protocols (PBFT and Bchain) for comparison. In these tests, our protocol outperformed the baselines by more than 2{\texttimes} in terms of throughput as well as latency.},

Yet, this paradigm continuously suffers from numerous security and privacy concerns mainly due to its massive scale, distributed nature, and scarcity of resources towards the edge of IoT networks. Interestingly, blockchain based techniques offer strong countermeasures to protect data from tampering while supporting the distributed nature of the IoT. However, the enormous amount of energy consumption required to verify each block of data make it difficult to use with resource-constrained IoT devices and with real-time IoT applications. Nevertheless, it can expose the privacy of the stakeholders due to its public ledger system even though it secures data from alterations. Edge computing approaches suggest a potential alternative to centralized processing in order to populate real-time applications at the edge and to reduce privacy concerns associated with cloud computing. Hence, this paper suggests the novel privacy preserving blockchain called TrustChain which combines the power of blockchains with trust concepts to eliminate issues associated with traditional blockchain architectures. This work investigates how TrustChain can be deployed in the edge computing environment with different levels of absorptions to eliminate delays and privacy concerns associated with centralized processing and to preserve the resources in IoT networks.},

Hence, there will never be an ideal DLT design for all DLT use cases; instead, DLT implementations need to be configured to contextual requirements. Successful DLT configuration requires, however, a sound understanding of DLT characteristics and their interdependencies. In this manuscript, we review DLT characteristics and organize them into six groups. Furthermore, we condense interdependencies of DLT characteristics into trade-offs that should be considered for successful deployment of DLT. Finally, we consolidate our findings into DLT archetypes for common design objectives, such as security, usability, or performance. Our work makes extant DLT research more transparent and fosters understanding of interdependencies and trade-offs between DLT characteristics.},

The first pillar, stronger resilience, involves a new fault model called alive-but-corrupt faults. Alive-but-corrupt replicas may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol in an attempt to break safety of the protocol. However, if they cannot break safety, they will not try to prevent liveness of the protocol. Combining alive-but-corrupt faults into the model, Flexible BFT is resilient to higher corruption levels than possible in a pure Byzantine fault model. The second pillar, diversity, designs consensus solutions whose protocol transcript is used to draw different commit decisions under diverse beliefs. With this separation, the same Flexible BFT solution supports synchronous and asynchronous beliefs, as well as varying resilience threshold combinations of Byzantine and alive-but-corrupt faults.},

	abstract = {State-machine replication, a fundamental approach to designing fault-tolerant services, requires commands to be executed in the same order by all replicas. Moreover, command execution must be deterministic: each replica must produce the same output upon executing the same sequence of commands. These requirements usually result in single-threaded replicas, which hinders service performance. This paper introduces Parallel State-Machine Replication (P-SMR), a new approach to parallelism in state-machine replication. P-SMR scales better than previous proposals since no component plays a centralizing role in the execution of independent commands{\textemdash}those that can be executed concurrently, as defined by the service. The paper introduces P-SMR, describes a {\textquotedblleft}commodified architecture" to implement it, and compares its performance to other proposals using a key-value store and a networked file system.},

Consequently, metrological regulation and control require more efforts from notified bodies, becoming slower and more expensive. In this paper, we evaluate the use of blockchains as a resource to overcome such challenges. We start with a conceptual model for implementing measuring instruments in a distributed blockchain-based architecture and compare it with traditional measuring instruments and distributed measuring models discussed in previous works. We also made a security analysis, demonstrating that blockchain-based measuring systems can impact the way measuring instruments are used in consumer relations while improving security and simplifying metrological regulation and control. We implement a vehicle speed measuring system using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. We evaluate the security and performance of our blockchain-based measuring system by executing tests with data from real speed meter sensors. The results are promising and validate the feasibility of our idea. Finally, we point out the main challenges related to our approach, suggesting alternatives and potential issues to be addressed by future works.},

In more detail, we produce two new randomized algorithms that solve this problem in the abstract MAC layer model, which captures the basic interface and communication guarantees provided by most wireless MAC layers. Our algorithms work for any number of failures, require no advance knowledge of the network participants or network size, and guarantee termination with high probability after a number of broadcasts that are polynomial in the network size. Our first algorithm satisfies the standard agreement property, while our second trades a faster termination guarantee in exchange for a looser agreement property in which most nodes agree on the same value. These are the first known fault-tolerant consensus algorithms for this model. In addition to our main upper bound results, we explore the gap between the abstract MAC layer and the standard asynchronous message passing model by proving fault-tolerant consensus is impossible in the latter in the absence of information regarding the network participants, even if we assume no faults, allow randomized solutions, and provide the algorithm a constant-factor approximation of the network size.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01980},
	abstract = {Consistency properties provided by most key-value stores can be classified into sequential consistency and eventual consistency. The former is easier to program with but suffers from lower performance whereas the latter suffers from potential anomalies while providing higher performance. We focus on the problem of what a designer should do if he/she has an algorithm that works correctly with sequential consistency but is faced with an underlying key-value store that provides a weaker (e.g., eventual or causal) consistency. We propose a detect-rollback based approach: The designer identifies a correctness predicate, say P , and continues to run the protocol, as our system monitors P . If P is violated (because the underlying key-value store provides a weaker consistency), the system rolls back and resumes the computation at a state where P holds. We evaluate this approach with graph-based applications running on the Voldemort key-value store. Our experiments with deployment on Amazon AWS EC2 instances shows that using eventual consistency with monitoring can provide a 50\% {\textendash} 80\% increase in throughput when compared with sequential consistency. We also observe that the overhead of the monitoring itself was low (typically less than 4\%) and the latency of detecting violations was small. In particular, in a scenario designed to intentionally cause a large number of violations, more than 99.9\% of violations were detected in less than 50 milliseconds in regional networks (all clients and servers in the same Amazon AWS region), and in less than 3 seconds in global networks. We find that for some applications, frequent rollback can cause the program using eventual consistency to effectively stall. We propose alternate mechanisms for dealing with re-occurring rollbacks. Overall, for applications considered in this paper, we find that even with rollback, eventual consistency provides better performance than using sequential consistency.},

	abstract = {Nakamoto{\textquoteright}s famous blockchain protocol enables achieving consensus in a so-called permissionless setting{\textemdash}anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution, and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players. His ingenious protocol prevents {\textquotedblleft}sybil attacks{\textquotedblright} (where an adversary spawns any number of new players) by relying on computational puzzles (a.k.a. {\textquotedblleft}moderately hard functions{\textquotedblright}) introduced by Dwork and Naor (Crypto{\textquoteright}92). Recent work by Garay et al (EuroCrypt{\textquoteright}15) and Pass et al (manuscript, 2016) demonstrate that this protocol provably achieves consistency and liveness assuming a) honest players control a majority of the computational power in the network, b) the puzzle-hardness is appropriately set as a function of the maximum network delay and the total computational power of the network, and c) the computational puzzle is modeled as a random oracle. Assuming honest participation, however, is a strong assumption, especially in a setting where honest players are expected to perform a lot of work (to solve the computational puzzles). In Nakamoto{\textquoteright}s Bitcoin application of the blockchain protocol, players are incentivized to solve these puzzles by receiving rewards for every {\textquotedblleft}block{\textquotedblright} (of transactions) they contribute to the blockchain. An elegant work by Eyal and Sirer (FinancialCrypt{\textquoteright}14), strengthening and formalizing an earlier attack discussed on the Bitcoin forum, demonstrates that a coalition controlling even a minority fraction of the computational power in the network can gain (close to) 2 times its {\textquotedblleft}fair share{\textquotedblright} of the rewards (and transaction fees) by deviating from the protocol instructions. In contrast, in a fair protocol, one would expect that players controlling a $\varphi$ fraction of the computational resources to reap a $\varphi$ fraction of the rewards.},

@article{passHybridConsensusEfficient,
	title = {Hybrid {Consensus}: {Efficient} {Consensus} in the {Permissionless} {Model}},
	abstract = {Consensus, or state machine replication is a foundational building block of distributed systems and modern cryptography. Consensus in the classical, permissioned setting has been extensively studied in the 30 years of distributed systems literature. Recent developments in Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies popularized a new form of consensus in a {\textquotedblleft}permissionless{\textquotedblright} setting, where anyone can join and leave dynamically, and there is no a-priori knowledge of the consensus nodes. Despite this exciting breakthrough, today{\textquoteright}s permissionless consensus protocols, often referred to as {\textquotedblleft}blockchains{\textquotedblright}, are known to have terrible performance, which has resulted in heated, and at times acrimonious debates in the community. First, we show that unfortunately a performance loss is inherent for any protocol that secures against at least 1/3 corruptions in hashpower. Specifically, we formally define a new performance measure called responsiveness, and show that any responsive permissionless consensus protocol cannot tolerate 1/3 or more corruptions in hashpower. Next, we show a tightly matching uppper bound. Specifically, we propose a new permissionless consensus protocol called hybrid consensus, that is responsive and secures against up to 1/3 corruptions (approximately) in hashpower. Hybrid consensus{\textquoteright}s idea is to bootstrap fast permissionless consensus by combining an inefficient blockchain protocol with a fast permissioned consensus protocol. Hybrid consensus uses the blockchain not to agree on transactions, but to agree on rotating committees which in turn execute permissioned consensus protocols to agree on transactions. Our paper is the first to give a formal treatment of how to correctly combine a proof-of-work blockchain with classical consensus to achieve a responsive permissionless consensus protocol. Our effort exposes a multitude of non-trivial technical subtleties and challenges that are crucial to the correctness of the protocol, but have been overlooked by earlier and concurrent ad-hoc approaches.},

However, the majority of the previous studies have focused on the technical aspects, and overlooked blockchain investigation from a managerial perspective. In this paper, based on platform-ecosystem, transaction cost economics, and open-source literature, we contrast and compare blockchain-based platforms and centralized platforms; in other words, decentralized versus centralized governance modes. We base our conceptual analysis on three dimensions{\textemdash}transaction cost, cost of technology, and community involvement{\textemdash}, exploring the conditions under which blockchain-based platforms are more advantageous than centralized platforms. We first compare gains from lower opportunism and uncertainty costs thanks to protocols and smart contracts in blockchain technology versus the costs of higher coordination and complexity of (re)writing those contracts. Second, we compare the gains from immutability and transparency in blockchain-based platforms versus the technological costs of verification and storage of a distributed ledger. Finally, we compare intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the communities around centralized and blockchain-based platforms in the short and medium term.},

In order to deal with this specific kind of threats, BFT protocols rely on request authentication to provide access control. Nevertheless, byzantine clients may benefit from the weakness of the underlying authentications mechanisms in order to tamper with the performance of replicated systems. We describe the main reliability issues that can be introduced by faulty clients in current BFT protocols, and we argue against the systematic usage of digital signatures.

Two confronting standpoints dominate the emergent debate around blockchain-based governance: discourses characterised by the presence of techno-determinist and market-driven values, which tend to ignore the complexity of social organisation; and critical accounts of such discourses which, whilst contributing to identifying limitations, consider the role of traditional centralised institutions as inherently necessary to enable democratic forms of governance. Therefore the question arises, can we build perspectives of blockchain-based governance that go beyond markets and states? In this article we draw on the Nobel laureate economist Elinor Ostrom{\textquoteright}s principles for self-governance of communities to explore the transformative potential of blockchain. We approach blockchain through the identification and conceptualisation of affordances that this technology may provide to communities. For each affordance, we carry out a detailed analysis situating each in the context of Ostrom{\textquoteright}s principles, considering both the potentials of algorithmic governance and the importance of incorporating communities{\textquoteright} social practices. The relationships found between these affordances and Ostrom{\textquoteright}s principles allow us to provide a perspective focussed on blockchain-based commons governance. By carrying out this analysis, we aim to expand the debate from one dominated by a culture of competition to one that promotes a culture of cooperation.},

Previously, consensus protocols were usually hardcoded into the blockchain infrastructure and could not be exchanged, therefore inhibiting flexible use of an otherwise generic blockchain infrastructure. Hyperledger Fabric claims to provide modular consensus and support for crash-fault and Byzantine fault tolerant protocols. However, integrating a BFT protocol has shown that Fabric{\textquoteright}s architecture is currently not well-suited for this fault model as it requires substantial changes and thereby breaks Fabric{\textquoteright}s modularity.

We extend such studies by adopting the Byzantine fault model, which encompasses crash faults as well as malicious faults. We carefully analyze the threats towards the operations in a system constructed with CRDTs, and propose a lightweight solution to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance with low runtime overhead. We define a set of correctness properties for such systems and prove that the proposed Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms guarantee these properties. Furthermore, we show that our mechanisms exhibit excellent performance with a proofof-concept replicated shopping cart service constructed using CRDTs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents Mir-BFT (or, simply, Mir), a robust Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) total order broadcast protocol aimed at maximizing throughput on wide-area networks (WANs), targeting permissioned and Proof-ofStake permissionless blockchains. We show that Mir achieves unprecedented throughput on WANs without sacrificing latency, robustness to malicious behavior, or even performance in clusters. Our evaluation shows that Mir orders more than 60000 signed Bitcoin-sized transactions per second on a widely distributed 100 nodes, 1 Gbps WAN setup, while preventing a range of attacks including request duplication performance attacks. To achieve this, Mir relies on a novel protocol mechanism that allows a set of leaders to propose request batches independently, in parallel, while rotating the assignment of a partitioned request hash space to leaders. Several optimizations boost Mir throughput even further, including partial replication through a novel abstraction we call light total order (LTO) broadcast. Perhaps most importantly, Mir relies on proven BFT protocol constructs, which simplifies reasoning about Mir correctness. Specifically, Mir is a generalization of the celebrated and scrutinized PBFT protocol. In a nutshell, Mir follows PBFT {\textquotedblleft}safety-wise{\textquotedblright}, with changes needed to accommodate novel features restricted to PBFT liveness.},

One domain is an application in cyber-physical systems (CPSs), e.g., as a building block for the (Industrial) Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0. In this regard, various use cases and designs have been proposed that seek to leverage the desirable properties blockchain technologies seem to offer. While many of the principles behind blockchain have actually been studied under the veil of Byzantine fault tolerance for decades, some approaches, such as relying on game-theoretic incentives and proof-of-work (PoW), are not yet fully understood. This knowledge gap can leave both practitioners and researchers in a difficult position regarding a possible application of such technologies, as it is often unclear what guarantees and characteristics a particular blockchain design actually achieves. This work-in-progress paper provides an overview of blockchain security research, outlines system designs that are likely to exhibit vulnerabilities, and provides examples of potentially insecure proposals in the field of CPSs that employ such designs.},

However, systems often rely on unpredictable and unreliable infrastructures, that suggest the use of asynchronous models. Several models have been proposed to address this issue. We propose an architectural construct that takes a generic approach to the problem of programming in the presence of uncertain timeliness. We assume the existence of a component, capable of executing timely functions, which helps applications with varying degrees of synchrony to behave reliably despite the occurrence of timing failures. We call this component the Timely Computing Base, TCB. This paper describes the TCB architecture and model, and discusses the application programming interface for accessing the TCB services. The implementation of the TCB services uses fail-awareness techniques to increase the coverage of TCB properties.},

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities and industries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and datadriven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this survey, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of incentivized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-ofthe-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review on the strategy adoption for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey on the emerging applications of the blockchain networks in a wide range of areas. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.},

	abstract = {ALGORAND is a celebrated public ledger technology designed by Dr. Micali and his collaborators. By the end of year 2018, it has raised US\$64 million in funding from venture capital firms. In this paper, we identify several design flaws of the ALGORAND protocol. In particular, we show that the claimed (proved) fork-free property is not true and several assumptions in ALGORAND are not realistic in practice. The ALGORAND wiki page https://golden.com/wiki/Algorand claims that {\textquotedblleft}the probability of a fork in the protocol is estimated at 1/1,000,000,000 and therefore blocks can be considered final upon validation{\textquotedblright}. However, our first attack in this paper shows that a malicious adversary who controls less than 1/3 of the users (or money units) could fork the ALGORAND chain very easily. Our second attack shows that a malicious adversary could use a bribery attack to fork the ALGORAND chain very easily also. Furthermore, we show that the celebrated Byzantine Agreement component in ALGORAND is not necessary. The Byzantine Agreement is the most expensive part and one of the most innovative parts in the ALGORAND protocol. It is used to avoid forks in ALGORAND. We show that a simple majority vote could be used to achieve the same property that Byzantine Agreement achieves in ALGORAND under the same network assumption.},

We show that if the broadcast primitive is not reliable then the PBFT and HotStuff BFT protocols could not achieve the liveness property (that is, the system will never reach an agreement on a proposal). Though these BFT protocols have been developed for partial synchronous networks, we show that they cannot achieve consensus in partial synchronous networks since the participants do not know what is the Global Stabilization Time (GST) and broadcast channels before GST are defined to be unreliable (e.g., DoS attacks on certain participants). Thus it is important for developers to be aware of these issues when developing applications (such as blockchains) using these BFT protocols.},

A recent analytical result by Pass, Seeman and shelat indicates that an idealized blockchain is indeed secure against attacks in an asynchronous network where messages are maliciously delayed by at most ? 1/np, with n being the number of miners and p the mining hardness. This paper improves upon the result by showing that if appropriate inconsistency tolerance is allowed the blockchain can withstand even more powerful external attacks in the honest miner setting. Specifically we prove that the blockchain is secure against long delay attacks with ? >= 1/np in an asynchronous network.},

An enticing formulation of this vision is Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) state machine replication, in which a group of servers collectively act as a correct server even if some of the servers misbehave or malfunction in arbitrary ({\textquotedblleft}Byzantine{\textquotedblright}) ways. Despite this promise, practitioners hesitate to deploy BFT systems, at least partly because of the perception that BFT must impose high overheads. In this article, we present Zyzzyva, a protocol that uses speculation to reduce the cost of BFT replication. In Zyzzyva, replicas reply to a client's request without first running an expensive three-phase commit protocol to agree on the order to process requests. Instead, they optimistically adopt the order proposed by a primary server, process the request, and reply immediately to the client. If the primary is faulty, replicas can become temporarily inconsistent with one another, but clients detect inconsistencies, help correct replicas converge on a single total ordering of requests, and only rely on responses that are consistent with this total order. This approach allows Zyzzyva to reduce replication overheads to near their theoretical minima and to achieve throughputs of tens of thousands of requests per second, making BFT replication practical for a broad range of demanding services.},

Today, there are still many misconceptions relating to Byzantine failure, what makes a system vulnerable, and indeed the very
nature and reality of Byzantine faults. This paper revisits the Byzantine problem from a practitioner{\textquoteright}s perspective. It has
the intention to provide the reader with a working appreciation of the Byzantine failure from a practical as well as a theoretical
perspective. A discussion of typical failure properties and the difficulties in preventing the associated failure propagation
is presented. These are illustrated with real Byzantine failure observations. Finally, various architectural solutions to

	abstract = {FTMP is a digital computer architecture which has evolved over a ten-year period in connection with several life-critical aerospace applications. Most recently it has been proposed as a fault-tolerant central computer for civil transport aircraft applications. A working emulation has been operating for some time, and the first engineering prototype is scheduled to be completed in late 1979. FTMP is designed to have a failure rate due to random causes of the order of 10-10failures per hour, on ten-hour flights where no air-borne maintenance is available. The prefered maintenance interval is of the order of hundreds of flight hours, and the probability that maintenance will be required earlier than the preferred interval is desired to be at most a few percent. The design is based on independent processor-cache memory modules and common memory modules which communicate via redundant serial buses. All information processing and transmission is conducted in triplicate so that local voters in each module can correct errors. Modules can be retired and/or reassigned in any configuration. Reconfiguration is carried out routinely from second to second to search for latent faults in the voting and reconfiguration elements. Job assignments are all made on a floating basis, so that any processor triad is eligible to execute any job step. The core software in the FFMP will handle all fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery in such a way that applications programs do not need to be involved. Failure-rate models and numerical results are described for both permanent and intermittent faults. A dispatch probability model is also presented. Experience with an experimental emulation is described.},

This article will discuss initial research and flight testing of approaches based on explicit fault detection, isolation, and estimation, as well as later approaches based on continuously adaptive and intelligent control algorithms. In addition, approaches for trajectory reshaping of an impaired aircraft with reconfigurable inner loop control laws will be briefly discussed. Finally, there will be some discussion on current implementations of reconfigurable control to improve safety on production and flight test aircraft and remaining challenges to enable broader use of the technology, such as the difficulties of flight certification of these types of approaches.},

In this paper, we describe an extremely simple and natural paradigm called Streamlet for constructing consensus protocols. Our protocols are inspired by the core techniques that have been uncovered in the past five years of work; but to the best of our knowledge our embodiment is simpler than ever before and we accomplish this by taking a ``streamlining'' idea to its full potential. We hope that our textbook constructions will help to decipher the past five years of work on consensus partly driven by the cryptocurrency community --- in particular, how remarkably simple the new generation of consensus protocols has become in comparison with classical mainstream approaches such as PBFT and Paxos.},

	abstract = {Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols allow a group of replicas to come to a consensus even when some of the replicas are Byzantine faulty. There exist multiple BFT protocols to securely tolerate an optimal number of faults \$t\$ under different network settings. However, if the number of faults \$f\$ exceeds \$t\$ then security could be violated. In this paper we mathematically formalize the study of forensic support of BFT protocols: we aim to identify (with cryptographic integrity) as many of the malicious replicas as possible and in as a distributed manner as possible. Our main result is that forensic support of BFT protocols depends heavily on minor implementation details that do not affect the protocol's security or complexity. Focusing on popular BFT protocols (PBFT, HotStuff, Algorand) we exactly characterize their forensic support, showing that there exist minor variants of each protocol for which the forensic supports vary widely. We show strong forensic support capability of LibraBFT, the consensus protocol of Diem cryptocurrency; our lightweight forensic module implemented on a Diem client is open-sourced and is under active consideration for deployment in Diem. Finally, we show that all secure BFT protocols designed for \$2t+1\$ replicas communicating over a synchronous network forensic support are inherently nonexistent; this impossibility result holds for all BFT protocols and even if one has access to the states of all replicas (including Byzantine ones).},

This approach yields an asynchronous consensus protocol for fail-stop nodes that may be simpler and more robust than Paxos and its leader-based variants, requiring no common coins and achieving consensus in a constant expected number of rounds. The same approach can be strengthened against Byzantine failures by building on well-established techniques such as tamper-evident logging and gossip, accountable state machines, threshold signatures and witness cosigning, and verifiable secret sharing. This combination of existing abstractions and threshold logical clocks yields a modular, cleanly-layered approach to building practical and efficient Byzantine consensus, distributed key generation, time, timestamping, and randomness beacons, and other critical services.},

Moreover, Sync HotStuff has optimistic responsiveness, i.e., it advances at network speed when less than one-quarter of the replicas are not responding. Borrowing from practical partially synchronous BFT solutions, Sync HotStuff has a two-phase leader-based structure, and has been fully prototyped under the standard synchrony assumption. When tolerating a single fault, Sync HotStuff achieves a throughput of over 280 Kops/sec under typical network performance, which is comparable to the best known partially synchronous solution.},

Recently it has been argued that fault detection can be factored out from computation, and that a generic fault detection service can be a useful abstraction for building distributed systems. However, while fault detection has been extensively studied for crash faults, little is known about detecting more general kinds of faults.
This paper explores the power and the inherent costs of generic fault detection in a distributed system. We propose a formal framework that allows us to partition the set of all faults that can possibly occur in a distributed computation into several fault classes. Then we formulate the fault detection problem for a given fault class, and we show that this problem can be solved for only two specific fault classes, namely omission faults and commission faults. Finally, we derive tight lower bounds on the cost of solving the problem for these two classes in asynchronous message-passing systems.},

Indulgent consensus algorithms are more robust in that they only require eventual synchrony, but are however typically leader-based. Intuitively, this is a weakness for a slow leader can delay any decision. This paper asks whether, under eventual synchrony, it is possible to deterministically solve consensus without a leader. The fact that the weakest failure detector to solve consensus is one that also eventually elects a leader seems to indicate that the answer to the question is negative. We prove in this paper that the answer is actually positive. We first give a precise definition of the very notion of a leaderless algorithm. Then we present three indulgent leaderless consensus algorithms, each we believe interesting in its own right: (i) for shared memory, (ii) for message passing with omission failures and(iii) for message passing with Byzantine failures (with and without authentication).},

Among the affected components are naming, authentication, authorization, accounting, communication, the use of remote resources, and the mechanisms by which users view the system.

	abstract = {With the advent of trusted execution environments provided by recent general purpose processors, a class of replication protocols has become more attractive than ever: Protocols based on a hybrid fault model are able to tolerate arbitrary faults yet reduce the costs significantly compared to their traditional Byzantine relatives by employing a small subsystem trusted to only fail by crashing. Unfortunately, existing proposals have their own price: We are not aware of any hybrid protocol that is backed by a comprehensive formal specification, complicating the reasoning about correctness and implications. Moreover, current protocols of that class have to be performed largely sequentially. Hence, they are not well-prepared for just the modern multi-core processors that bring their very own fault model to a broad audience. In this paper, we present Hybster, a new hybrid state-machine replication protocol that is highly parallelizable and specified formally. With over 1 million operations per second using only four cores, the evaluation of our Intel SGX-based prototype implementation shows that Hybster makes hybrid state-machine replication a viable option even for today's very demanding critical services.},

Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos.

For example, it provides an opportunity for the organization that owns the broker to tamper with the data. In this work, we contribute Trinity, a novel distributed publish-subscribe broker with Byzantine faulttolerance and blockchain-based immutability. Trinity distributes the data published to one of the brokers in the network to all the brokers in the network, and stores the data in an immutable ledger through the use of blockchain technology.
