<p>The European Council has repeatedly called for a coordinated approach<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id1">1</a> on interoperable vaccination certificates and the mutual recognition of test results.</p>
<p>The Guidelines<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id5" id="id2">2</a> adopted by the eHealth Network<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id6" id="id3">3</a> rest on three pillars: a minimum data set, a standard unique identifier for such proofs, and a trust framework, which provides the basis for establishing the certificates’ authenticity, integrity and validity.</p>
<p>This document outlines the trust framework and provides the basis for discussion with Member States on the implementation of interoperable certificates in EU Member States. Further elaboration on the specifications of the technical implementation will follow. The document may be subject to future modification as the COVID-19 situation evolves.</p>

<p>The trust framework defines the rules, policies, protocols, formats and standards needed to ensure that Covid-19 health certificates are issued in such a way that their authenticity and integrity can be verified and trusted.</p>
<p>The trust framework shall be flexible enough to encompass different use cases. It defines provisions that allow both digital and analogue, off-line and on-line versions of the COVID-19 health certificates, as well as the associated verification.</p>

<p>The journey of the Covid-19 health certificate is completed in 3 distinct steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>the collection and registration of data about the medical events for competent authorised entities in a health information system,</p></li>
<li><p>the issuance of the Covid-19 health certificate, and</p></li>
<li><p>the presentation of the Covid-19 health certificate to a verifier (e.g. a border guard or a healthcare professional) for its verification.</p></li>

</div>
<p>A certificate relies on a minimum dataset. Included in the minimum dataset is a Unique Vaccination Certificate/assertion identifier (UVCI), which could be used as a link to the underlying data registry. The use of UVCI or other methods for online verification will be defined in more detail in the next versions of the Trust Framework.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">PrivacyCred</p>
<p>The PrivacyCred implementation uses a UUID Version 4 which is truly random as specified in <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">RFC 4122</a>. The UUID has no relationship at all with any data inside the certificate and so is unlinkable.
Each certificate has a different UUID even if they refer to the same person.</p>
</div>
<p>The verifier of a certificate should be able to establish that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The certificate has been issued by an authorised entity;</p></li>
<li><p>The information presented on the certificate is authentic, valid, and has not been altered;</p></li>
<li><p>The certificate can be linked to the holder of the certificate;</p></li>

<h3><span class="section-number">2.2.1. </span>Main design principles and business requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#main-design-principles-and-business-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The design of the trust framework for EU-interoperable issuing of COVID-19 health certificates and verification of their integrity and authenticity relies on key design principles listed below. The list is not prioritised. Instead, the trust framework that is specified later in the document attempts to optimise as many of the key design principles as possible.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Cross-border interoperability.</strong></dt><dd><p>National implementations of certificates that comply with the specifications of the trust framework should be interoperable. This means that if Countries A and B implement the specifications, it should be possible for a verifier in Country B to verify a digital vaccination certificate that has been issued in Country A.</p>
<p>Cross-border interoperability should be ensured across EU and EEA countries. The Trust Framework should not prevent interoperability with the solutions designed on a global level, such as the one being developed by the WHO or ICAO. This is one of the primary design principles and it has implications in all components of the proposed trust framework.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Data protection (including data minimisation, purpose limitation, etc.).</strong></dt><dd><p>The trust framework should protect the data of the involved individual stakeholders (most importantly, certificate holders). This covers several data protection dimensions catered by the General Data Protection Regulation, including purpose limitation and data minimisation. In practice, only the bare minimum set of data that is required for the supported use cases should be processed (data minimisation) and the purpose of data collection should be checked against the use cases (purpose limitation). Similarly, only the bare minimum set of data that is required for the supported use cases should be presented to a specific verifier (data minimisation) and the purpose of data presentation should be checked against the use cases (purpose limitation). In order to achieve the latter, the trust framework may support different presentation datasets for different verifier scenarios. The data protection principle has a strong impact on the specification of the Minimum Dataset and the design of the use cases of the trust framework.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Data security and privacy by design and by default.</strong></dt><dd><p>Abuse of data by actors (especially, the certificate verifiers and holders) and forgery should be prevented by any reasonable means. The trust framework should by design and default ensure the security and the privacy of data in the compliant implementations of digital vaccination certificate systems, ensuring both security and privacy. Available tools should be used for restricting access to data and preventing malicious use of data, while the establishing of the authenticity of data and its link to the certificate holder should be ensured. The design should prevent the collection of identifiers or other similar data which might be crossreferenced with other data and re-used for tracking (‘Unlinkability’). Further discussions are needed as to the technological aspects and timeline for the incorporation of these features in the trust framework.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Inclusiveness (especially medium-neutrality).</strong></dt><dd><p>The trust framework should be inclusive both towards Member States’ approaches and the individual citizen (‘no citizen left behind’). The design of the trust framework should attempt to maximize its support for diverse contexts (e.g., high resource vs low resource contexts). To enable this, the trust framework should support a spectrum of certificate presentation media from plain paper certificate to augmented paper certificates (e.g., paper certificate with printed machinereadable parts such as barcodes, QR codes, Machine Readable Zones) and to purely digital certificates (e.g., in-app certificates).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">PrivacyCred</p>
<p>The PrivacyCred system supports paper certificates, augmented paper certificates, QR codes and purely digital certificates.</p>
<p>In addition, contrary to many SSI Verifiable Credentials implementations, the PrivacyCred system is implemented as a PWA (Progressive Web App) that can be used simply in a mobile browser (or tablet/PC) without installing anything in the device or registering for anything.</p>
<p>However, the user can install the PWA in the device if the user so wishes to facilitate future uses. In any case, the system does not require any type of registration of the identity of the user.</p>
</div>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>Simplicity and user-friendliness.</strong></dt><dd><p>It is very important that the trust framework is designed with simplicity and user-friendliness of the possible implementation of digital certificate systems in mind. More formally, the trust framework should not have features or functionalities that would unnecessarily complicate the resulting implementation of a digital vaccination certificate system or make them unnecessarily difficult to use. Lack of simplicity could increase the time it takes to implement the compliant digital vaccination certificate systems, while lack of user friendliness could hinder the uptake of the resulting implementations. User-friendliness is relevant for quick and easy processing, specifically to certificate holders and to verifiers.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">PrivacyCred</p>
<p>The PrivacyCred system follows the rule of <em>Occam’s Razor</em> eliminating any feature or functionality which is not strictly required for the use case.</p>
<p>This not only provides simplicity and user-friendlyness but also provides a system easier to understand and maintain which is more secure and robust.</p>
</div>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>Implementation flexibility.</strong></dt><dd><p>The trust framework specifications should provide implementers with a variety of options when developing digital vaccination certificate systems according to the trust framework specifications. This key design principle aims at reducing the implementation time and leveraging/reusing existing infrastructures in Member States. To satisfy this principle, the trust framework specifies, whenever possible, a list of alternative methods, flows, architectures and implementation options, for example alternative presentation media, verification options, implementation technologies, etc. whilst still guaranteeing the same level of trustworthiness.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Modularity and scalability.</strong></dt><dd><p>This is strongly linked with the previous key design principle. The trust framework architecture should be modular and easily scalable, for instance, to additional usage scenarios, use cases and types of certificates. The trust framework already supports different usage scenarios (e.g. alternative settings in which certificates may be requested or verification may take place). Examples of other types of certificates that could be supported by potential extensions of the trust framework include certificate of negative COVID-19 tests and certificates of recovery from COVID-19, while examples of other use cases that could be supported are travel or (participation in) leisure activities (i.e. proof of vaccination for non-health-related purposes in domestic or international settings). Decisions related to ethical, societal or political questions pertaining to the use cases should be tackled separately. To satisfy this key design principle, special attention has been paid in the design of the trust framework architecture with clear separation of the steps of the user story detailed below.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">PrivacyCred</p>
<p>The PrivacyCred system was designed from the ground up to fully support use cases like certificates of negative COVID-19 tests, certificates of recovery from COVID-19, vacccination certificates, and their potential use in travel and leisure activities.</p>
<p>It has been designed explicitly to maintain total unlinkability among certificates and each of them are treated as if they were a unique “piece of paper” but with the power of the digitalization. That means that the system is not suitable for use cases where linkability is required. In any case, that linkability should be implemented in the existing information systems of the health entities issuing the certificates.</p>
</div>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>Open standards.</strong></dt><dd><p>The trust framework should rely for its implementations on open standards, to the extent that this is possible. This will greatly contribute to the interoperability of the resulting implementations, in addition combined with open governance and open source implementations, it will instil trust in the involved stakeholders.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">2.2.3. </span>ID binding and verification<a class="headerlink" href="#id-binding-and-verification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An important parameter of the trust framework pertains to the identity of the subject of the certificate i.e., the person for whom the certificate is issued. The identity of this subject shall be bound to a certificate when the latter is issued (ID binding) and has to be verified when the certificate is being presented and verified (ID verification). These two processes (ID binding at the Issuance step and ID verification at the Presentation and Verification step) prevent possible impersonation attempts (i.e., a person fraudulently presenting a certificate that has been issued to someone else as if it were their own), and are in line with the data security and privacy by design and default principles of the trust framework.</p>
<p>The processes of ID binding and/or verification may be optional for some usage scenarios in the scope of the trust framework. For instance, in some settings the simple presentation of the certificate to a healthcare professional for medical purposes might be enough without additional actions for proving the ownership of the certificate if complemented by good clinical practices. However, in those usage scenarios where the aforementioned process cannot be omitted, the trust framework, adhering to the simplicity and user-friendliness principle, shall rely on (nationally and/or internationally) established methods for ID binding and verification. In other words, the trust framework does not specify in its architecture dedicated components or modalities for undertaking the ID binding and verification process.</p>
<p>The recommended methods for performing ID binding and verification employ nationally issued identity proof documents, such as national IDs and passports. Such identity proof documents should be presented at the time of issuance (ID binding) and verification (ID verification) of the certificate and therein personally identifying information should be compared against the information in the certificate.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">PrivacyCred</p>
<p>The PrivacyCred system assumes nationally issued identity proof documents for ID binding, both at issuance and verification.</p>
<p>Contrary to many SSI Verifiable Credentials implementations, the PrivacyCred system does not require any registration on the part of the user (like registering her DID in the blockchain or any other repository).</p>
<p>The only personal information managed by the system is the one in the minimum dataset as specified in the document <a class="reference external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/vaccination-proof_interoperability-guidelines_en.pdf">Guidelines on verifiable vaccination certificates - basic interoperability elements</a> from the eHealth Network.
The personal data elements are incorporated to the certificate and not used for any other thing or purpose.
It is assumed that the minimal person identification data specified in the eHealth Network document can be used to perform the ID binding with a national ID, passport or any other suitable nationally issued identity document.</p>

<p>This chapter provides an overview of the trust architecture and describes its main components. The chapter contains requirements directed at the Member States acting in the roles of issuers and verifiers.</p>
<p>The WHO is developing a global trust framework based on a similar approach. The framework is centred around the Global Health Trust Anchor operated and governed by the WHO and based on the technical specifications derived from ICAO’s Public Key Directory (PKD) model.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.1. </span>Overall description<a class="headerlink" href="#overall-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The EU trust framework is designed to be largely decentralised.</p>
<p>As per the digital contact tracing apps and the European Federation Gateway Service, this reflects the divergent structures and approaches within the EU Member States. That is to say, it aims to avoid centralisation where possible in line with the principle of flexibility.</p>
<p>However, there are some centralised elements:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Roots of trust stored in a common directory/gateway (EU Public Key Directory/Gateway), similar to the public key certificate provision process established in the EFGS.</p></li>
<li><p>Governance model.</p></li>

<p>The country of issuance, through its competent health entities, is responsible for the recording of health data and issuing certificates. It is also possible for the issuer to deliver a certificate based on reliable information received from other sources.</p>
<p>The Country A that is participating to the interoperability scheme shall issue certificates at least in the form of the augmented paper (paper augmented with digital artefacts such as barcodes or QR codes). In addition, Country A may issue certificates stored as purely digital files in apps or computers.</p>
<p>The Country A shall assign a national Public Health Authority (PHA) responsible for the system. The name of the PHA shall be communicated to other members of the interoperability scheme through the eHealth Network secretariat.</p>

<p>A system used by Country A for maintaining details about healthcare organisations authorised to issue health certificates.</p>
<p>The list should be established and maintained by every Country A, and it should be published on its PHA’s website (national backend server). In addition, the list may also be published through an open API.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">SafeIsland</p>
<p>The SafeIsland system provides a blockchain-based list of authorised issuers. It can be complementary to a national backend server for publishing the list, or even a complete replacement. It is enough that the PHA operates a node in the blockchain network and publishes the data in that node. Automatically, the data is securely hyper-replicated to all other connected nodes where many different types of verifiers can securely and efficiently query the data for verification. This could be very useful for example for certificates used in travel and leisure where the number of verifiers can be much higher than just the airports.</p>

<p>The trust framework described in this document is also subject to legal considerations.</p>
<p>As <em>some of the processing operations described involve personal data</em> (e.g. issuance and verification of certificates) such processing will fall under the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)footnote:[OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p.1].</p>
<p>GDPR provides for obligations on controllers (entities determining the purposes and means of processing of personal data, here e.g. organisations issuing and verifying vaccination certificates), such as to have a <em>legal basis</em> for their processing operations, <strong>document them</strong>, implement <strong>appropriate security measures</strong>, and to <em>inform data subjects</em> (natural persons data relating to whom are processed). It also provides rights for data subjects, such as the right to access the data controllers hold about them and to have it corrected. Additionally, GDPR establishes rules for <em>transfers</em> of personal data outside the EU/EEA.</p>

<p>The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) specifications will be used for digitally signing the machine readable certificate data.</p>
<p>To meet the timeline of this effort, and to ensure reliable and secure implementations of the technical specifications, the primary signing scheme for digital signatures supported by the trust framework is EC-DSA (Elliptic-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for cross-border use where unlinkability does not apply. As a fallback, RSA is also supportedfootnote:[The RSA signing scheme should only be used if it is absolutely necessary, as it adds an around 50% size overhead to the resulting health certificate.].</p>
<p>To further address the development of a privacy preserving approach for the anticipated domestic use case, adding further cryptographic schemes such as CL or BBS+ will be supported outside of cross border scenarios.</p>

<p>Offline verification shall be supported. By the term offline we refer to the scenario where the verifier requires at the time of the verification needs no online access to external resources (such as a call centre or a webapp) to perform the verification. Instead, the digital signature included in the 2D barcode will be verified through dedicated verification software. Signature verification will include (1) the verification of its validity against the provided public key and (2) the check that the public key is on the list of trusted keys held by the verifier app. The list will be fetched periodically from the EU PKD, however in the first phases of deployment, direct exchanges of keys may be used, as described in Section 3.1.3. Once this digital signature has been verified, the verification software can decode the information in the 2D barcode and rely on its content.</p>
